My parents lived in one of those country houses called chateaux, which are merely old houses with pointed roofs, to which are attached three or four</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">The village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a few hundred yards off and nestled round the church, a red brick church, which had become black with age.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Well, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came</div></div>

She had them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on her cheeks, and her eyebrows, which</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 42</a><div class="page-content">were extraordinarily thick and long and quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of mustaches stuck on there by mistake.<span class="fmt0"></span>

Her walk reminded one of a ship in a storm, and her head, which was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 42</a><div class="page-content">always covered with an enormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to traverse the horizon from north to south and from south to north at each limp.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as</div></div>

As soon as I arrived she made me take the foot warmer and sit upon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large chilly room under the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"That draws the blood from your head," she would say to me.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">She told me stories while mending the linen with her long, crooked, nimble fingers; behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had impaired her sight,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 42</a><div class="page-content">her eyes appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">As far as I can remember from the things which she told me and by which my childish heart was moved, she had the large heart of a poor woman. She told me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 42</a><div class="page-content">what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the cow house and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet's mill looking at the sails turning, or about a hen's egg which had been found in the church belfry without anyone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 42</a><div class="page-content">being able to understand what creature had been there to lay it, or the queer story of Jean Pila's dog who had gone ten leagues to bring back his master's breeches which a tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors after he had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 42</a><div class="page-content">been caught in the rain. She told me these simple adventures in such a manner that in my mind they assumed the proportions of never-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the ingenious stories invented by the poets, which my mother</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 42</a><div class="page-content">told me in the evening, had none of the flavor, none of the fullness or of the vigor of the peasant woman's narratives.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Well, one Thursday when I had spent all the morning in listening to Mother Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the day after picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm. I remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">On opening the door of the linen room I saw the old seamstress lying on the floor by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the side of her chair, her face turned down and her arms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of my shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer one no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 42</a><div class="page-content">spectacles glistened by the wall, where they had rolled away from her.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few minutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I cannot describe the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 42</a><div class="page-content">profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred my childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing room and hid myself in a dark corner in the depths of a great old armchair, where I knelt and wept. I remained there for a long time, no doubt, for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 42</a><div class="page-content">night came on. Suddenly someone came in with a lamp--without seeing me, however--and heard my father and mother talking with the medical man, whose voice recognized.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">He had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the cause</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 42</a><div class="page-content">of the accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down and had a glass of liqueur and a biscuit.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">He went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my mind until I die. I think that I can give the exact words which he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 42</a><div class="page-content">used.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Ah!" he said. "The poor woman! she broke her leg the day of my arrival here. I had not even had time to wash my hands after getting off the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a bad case, very bad.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"She was seventeen and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would anyone believe it? I have never told her story before; in fact, no one but myself and one other person, who is no longer living in this part of the country, ever knew it. Now that she is dead I may</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 42</a><div class="page-content">be less discreet.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"A young assistant teacher had just come to live in the village; he was good looking and had the bearing of a soldier. All the girls ran after him, but he was disdainful. Besides that, he was very much afraid of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 42</a><div class="page-content">his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu, who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense, who has just died here and who was afterward nicknamed Clochette.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 42</a><div class="page-content">The assistant master singled out the pretty young girl who was no doubt flattered at being chosen by this disdainful conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and he succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the hayloft behind</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the school at night after she had done her day's sewing.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left the Grabus', she went upstairs and hid among the hay to wait for her lover. He soon joined her, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 42</a><div class="page-content">he was beginning to say pretty things to her, when the door of the hayloft opened and the schoolmaster appeared and asked: 'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?' Feeling sure that he would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 42</a><div class="page-content">replied stupidly: 'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of hay, Monsieur Grabu.'<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"The loft was very large and absolutely dark. Sigisbert pushed the frightened girl to the farther end and said: 'Go, there and hide yourself. I shall</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 42</a><div class="page-content">lose my situation, so get away and hide yourself.'<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"When the schoolmaster heard the whispering he continued: 'Why, you are not by yourself.'<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!'<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"'But you are not, for you are talking.'<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.'<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"'I will soon find out,' the old man replied and, double-locking the door, he went down to get a light.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Then the young man,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 42</a><div class="page-content">who was a coward such as one sometimes meets, lost his head, and he repeated, having grown furious all of a sudden: 'Hide yourself, so that he may not find you. You will deprive me of my bread for my whole life; you will ruin my whole career! Do hide</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 42</a><div class="page-content">yourself!'<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"They could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense ran to the window which looked out onto the street, opened it quickly and then in a low and determined voice said: 'You will come and pick me up when he is gone,' and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 42</a><div class="page-content">she jumped out.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Old Grabu found nobody and went down again in great surprise! A quarter of an hour later Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his adventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall, unable to get up, as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 42</a><div class="page-content">she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to fetch her. It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate girl home with me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the bones had come out through the flesh. She did not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 42</a><div class="page-content">complain and merely said with admirable resignation: 'I am punished, well punished!'<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"I sent for assistance and for the workgirl's friends and told them a made-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed her</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 42</a><div class="page-content">outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole month tried in vain to find the author of this accident.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"That is all! Now I say that this woman was a heroine and had the fiber of those who accomplish the grandest deeds in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 42</a><div class="page-content">history.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr, a noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not absolutely admire her I should not have told you this story, which I would never tell anyone during her life;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 42</a><div class="page-content">you understand why."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The doctor ceased; Mamma cried, and Papa said some words which I did not catch; then they left the room, and I remained on my knees in the armchair and sobbed, while I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps and something knocking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 42</a><div class="page-content">against the side of the staircase.<span class="fmt0"></span>
