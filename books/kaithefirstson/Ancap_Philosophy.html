<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Anarcho-Capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of the individual's sovereignty in a free market. In any anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts, and other security services would be provided by privately run competitors</div></div>

Ancaps argue for a society based on the voluntary trade of private property and services in order to avoid conflict while maximizing</div></div>

Ancaps see free-market capitalism as the basis for a free and prosperous society. Ancaps argue that the state is an initiation of force because it can be used against those who have not stolen private property, committed criminal fraud. Many also</div></div>

Though Ancaps are known for asserting a right to private (individualized or joint non-public) property, some agree that non-state public or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 32</a><div class="page-content">community property can also exist in a Anarcho-Capitalist society. For them, what is important is that property is acquired and transferred without help or hindrance from the compulsory state. Many ancaps believe that the only just, and/or most</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Civcraft originally came into existence as Ancap-Minecraft, without any particular goal in mind.

The level of cooperation that this civilization fostered rapidly brought the server to a Utopian</div></div>

The land became dull and the community was faced with the prospect of becoming stale. To deal with this, Ancap-Minecraft became Civcraft; a grand experiment of communities,politics, discussion, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 32</a><div class="page-content">debate. Civcraft was from the beginning a different place than Ancap-Minecraft, it was to become more open place and changes were made to make the
political dynamics and their ramifications all the more persistent. Ancap philosophy in Civcraft centers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 32</a><div class="page-content">around respect for private property and non-coercion; from these two central rules, many Ancap policies flow. Respect for private property means that what people create and build and own is to be respected and unmolested, and their original intent should</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 32</a><div class="page-content">be respected. For example: if someone built a farm that was dependent upon the sunlight, then building a giant pixel art wall after the farm was
established that blocked out the sun would infringe upon the farm's integrity and it's intent. Non-coercion</div></div>

used force to take seize the property, Ancaps would hold that the property was not acquired legally and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 32</a><div class="page-content">possession was illegitimate. Ancaps generally believe that monopolies are structurally inclined to drift towards an authoritarian state and inefficient behavior over time. Competition produces new developments whereas Monopolies perpetuate the established</div></div>

Monopolies are often inclined toward inefficiency due to their lack of competition, over time without sufficient challenge such a Monopoly becomes</div></div>

For example, a police force that has a monopoly on the use of force often is progressively corrupt over time. Ancaps in Civcraft want property to be</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Central to Anarcho-Capitalism are the concept of self-ownership and the concept of original application. Everyone is the proper owner of his own physical body as well as of all places and nature-given goods that he occupies and puts to use by means of his</div></div>
