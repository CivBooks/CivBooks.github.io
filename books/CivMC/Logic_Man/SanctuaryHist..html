 In Volume I of Sanctuary's history, our founder GameNBurger speaks of how Sanctuary stands for all, as a safe haven, a safe place. When he wrote those words we certainly were a safe place. However,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 29</a><div class="page-content">as I put these words to the page, Sanctuary is not safe. We have been griefed, ransacked and our citizens have mostly tried up. In my mind, this is the downfall of Sanctuary in CivTemp. 

Perhaps in 3.0 we will find a more prosperous existence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 29</a><div class="page-content">But for now, I will chronicle the downfall of our city as we sink slowly into inactivity and disrepair.

I will split things into chapters as I experience them.</div></div>

In a world that is supposed to be filled with civilisations, being lonely is a curse.

For a while, Sanctuary was one of the last beacons of activity in Aleph. It was truly a bustling place.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Newfriends would join every day or so. The city would be carved away until we had more houses and parks spring up.

However, all good things must come to an end sometime. And for Sanctuary, that end came surprisingly quickly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 29</a><div class="page-content">I didn't know if people were just losing interest in the city, or in CivTemp in general. But our numbers dwindled. I walked the stone streets alone, hearing only the echoes of my own footsteps.

One day, GameNBurger informed me of his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 29</a><div class="page-content">latest grand scheme. He was convincing the remaining citizens of Aleph to come to a new settlement where factories could be brought together along with one big community.

Originally called Aleph League United, I suggested calling it Aleph City.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 29</a><div class="page-content">The name stuck.

GameNBurger, AerolessTheNerd, myself and other Sanctuary citizens set about building the infrastructure for
Aleph City.

Roads, lakes, buildings sprung out of our own efforts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Aeroless and a team of Sanctuary citizens built a road direct to the Great Aleph River to promote trade and traffic towards us.

While we worked away however, the foundations became shaky. Many of the remaining citizens of other nations</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 29</a><div class="page-content">expressed concerns that the location was too Sanctuary centric, or that our cultures and ideologies would clash. 

While I agree with this, hesitation only slowed our momentum and soon work slowed to a crawl. I found myself walking among the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 29</a><div class="page-content">half-constructed city, the only defender standing against the griefers and murderers of the Aleph forests.

I still bore my shield emblazoned with Sanctuary's banner. I am a true cave-dweller to my last breath.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 29</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>      Griefers<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

I logged on to Aleph City one morning to find a newfriend named Enderminecraft12 breaking chests. After interrogating him, he said that he wanted to fill the role of a "town burglar".

I thought he was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 29</a><div class="page-content">roleplaying heavily, but would not tolerate crime in our streets. I told him to beat it and logged off.

Next time I logged in, the town had been griefed again. I saw Ender in the middle of the town, and slew him with my sword.

I had no pearls</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 29</a><div class="page-content">unfortunately and he respawned to seek revenge.

Ender enlisted his brother Hampsterman to attack the city. Together they raided iron-reinforced chests and stole quantities of iron, gold and other materials from Sanctuary.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 29</a><div class="page-content">When I logged on and discovered this, they taunted me in chat. I knew they were nearby and searched until I found them in an unreinforced bunker. I waterlogged the bunker and killed Hampsterman.

They will return, but I imagine they won't stand for being</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 29</a><div class="page-content">humiliated like this.

My lesson to any other nations - be ready to pearl at all times. Sometimes it is neccesary to protect your creations.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 29</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>    GameNBurger<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>       Retires<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

It had been two weeks but still no news on when Aleph City would go public. I messaged GameNBurger about it.

"I'm taking a break from CivTemp, until 3.0" he said. It was understandable, but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 29</a><div class="page-content">it left Aleph City and Sanctuary both without leaders. I didn't know what to do. I had to remain vigilant. As I stored my loot from killing Enderminecraft and Hampsterman, I vowed to protect Sanctuary until I could no longer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 29</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>      Moving On<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

It's clear to me now that Sanctuary's time in this world is over.

The criminal Enderminecraft12 has been pearled and vaulted. Aeroless, Keeblers and other citizens of Sanctuary are in the process of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 29</a><div class="page-content">moving to the new Aleph City. I'm taking over administration for these projects and I need to focus on my new city.

Sanctuary will stay remembered in our hearts. Maybe one day, in 3.0 it will return but for now it's time to lay this great city to rest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Goodnight Sanctuary. you will be there for newfriends to marvel at for years to come and your legacy will live on in all of our hearts.

See you in Aleph City.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 29</a><div class="page-content">

I carved a gem out from the rock, its glistening brilliance astounded me.

I marveled at it.
Wonder filled my
heart and mind.
I passed it to my friend.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 29</a><div class="page-content">

The gem passed through many hands. Some rough, some clean, some weathered.

When the gem came back to me, its brilliance was dulled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 29</a><div class="page-content">It was no longer a gem. It was once more a rock.

The others were not malicious. They just wanted to enjoy it as I had.

Ultimately it was worth it, I decide. I begin to dig again.

I find another gem.</div></div>
