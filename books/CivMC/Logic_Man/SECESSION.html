As the Northern hemisphere lay dormant under the oppressive blanket of winter, Mt. Augusta was entering an election cycle.

Coming out of a period of stagnation and dilapidation from the</div></div>

Mt. Augusta had always occupied a relatively strategic position in Civcraft 1.0.

During the pre-HCF era, the city was a</div></div>

When the HCF launched their Christmas Invasion, however, the importance of Mt. Augusta made it an important target.</div></div>

In the month that followed, the organisation known as the </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>World Police</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>, an</div></div>

Immediately after the liberation, the World Police was tasked with rebuilding the political landscape of the city</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 59</a><div class="page-content">and creating an interim government.

Shortly after the liberation of Augusta, the World Police placed the city under the control of a satellite organisation called the TC, or the Trading Company.

Owned and operated</div></div>

The World Police- backed TC had nominated one of the representatives of the TC, <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>ShadedJon,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> who was being backed by a massive,</div></div>

The odds looked to be decisively in his favor, and the election looked secure.

However, a new, slightly obscure candidate had entered the race only a few days before the election.</div></div>

As February Third</div></div>
