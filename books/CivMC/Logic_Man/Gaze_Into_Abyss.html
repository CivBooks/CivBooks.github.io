One glance at the inactive cities on the <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>civtransport</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> map will show that there are far more inactive towns than there are active towns.</div></div>

In the fall of 2013, <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Sashimii, </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>King of the Commonwealth, posted advertisements for Civcraft to 4chan.

This was not the first post about Civcraft to 4chan,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 47</a><div class="page-content">but it was the first one to be seen by <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Rydenstrife</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>. He and a sizeable group of players were ready to create a nation.

The established Civcraft community was uneasy with the idea of 4chan joining the server.</div></div>

Five kilometers away, King <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ninj3rz </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>and his subordinates had recently finished the building of their city.

The group consisted of a well knit community of friends.</div></div>

Being very close to the origin meant that new players spawned frequently around them.

Recruitment was easy because of this, but retention was difficult.</div></div>

These colonies were known as the <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Federal Association of Grand Territories (FAGT).</div></div>

These two came across Nowhere, which housed a brand new cactus farm. The farm was griefed, which sent Nowhere into a manhunt.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 47</a><div class="page-content">This was not new to Nowhere, so the fast reaction meant the pearling of <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Zuhalter</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>.

Nowhere, and the entire server except for a few select cities, had no idea what FAGT was, so to them they held the pearl of the typical two bit minecraft griefer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Nowhere had no idea that they were on the brink of war.

FAGT was in a tough spot here. Members debated whether they should lose a member to an outside force or if they should attempt to get the pearl back.</div></div>

He claimed leadership of a foreign nation the people of Nowhere had never heard of.

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ninj3rz </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>made the rash decision to pearl <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ryden.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

FAGT was in their first war, and they were not going to allow their leader to be imprisoned.

FAGT (along with some allies from <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>XIphias</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>) quickly raided the already war weary town of Nowhere.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 47</a><div class="page-content">It was a quick victory. <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ryden</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> was freed, and <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ninj3rz</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> was now the pearled leader.

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ninj3rz</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> was put on trial for aggressing on a negotiator.

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ninj3rz</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> ended up having to pay FAGT a large sum of cacti for his freedom.</div></div>

When the results of the trial were posted to the subreddit, the community was confused.

They had never heard of FAGT, and had no idea Nowhere was at war with them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Although the annals of CivCraft history doesn’t have a spot for the raid of Nowhere, there is a lot we can learn from this conflict.

It wasn’t a battle between the HCF and a world force, nor was it a role-played war between friends that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 47</a><div class="page-content">we usually hear about.
It was a rare instance of a battle between two states.

There’s much we can learn both historically and politically from analyzing this war.

One similarity between FAGT and Nowhere was their history of dealing with grief.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The title of this book is a reference to <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Nietzsche’s</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> famous “Gaze into the abyss” quote.

States that deal with the barbarism that is grief tend to become more aggressive towards outsiders.</div></div>

The grief of the cactus farm was probably due to the fact that FAGT recently got dealt a heavy blow by <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Sloth,</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> and many of its members needed to feel dominant.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The grief did not end with the trial. Nowhere’s armory and factories were griefed beyond repair shortly after the trial.

With the town now razed, they had to relocate to the outskirts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 47</a><div class="page-content">They formed the town of <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Neverwhere</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>, which was incorporated into FAGT.

The FAGT headquarters was also razed, which caused them to solidify in their faux capital <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Titan.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 47</a><div class="page-content">What was supposed to be a lightning rod for grief became their new headquarters.

These moves finally stopped the constant grief the two experienced, and brought stability to their towns.</div></div>

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ninj3rz,</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> who always made decisions on his own, was seen by many as incompetent or inconsiderate.</div></div>
