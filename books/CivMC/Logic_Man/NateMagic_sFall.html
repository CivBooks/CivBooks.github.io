NateMagic would fulfill many roles through his life during the First Era of CivCraft. 

The goal of this book is to outline the life</div></div>

During the First Era, Nate would go from a wanderer, to a notable citizen of Lazuli, a war veteran,</div></div>

So, we'll start at the beginning.

His journey began like most Civcraftians. He awoke in an unfamiliar place.

Nate wandered for a few days before making contact with a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 40</a><div class="page-content">friend of his, blizzxx, who was currently living in Lazuli, a small city at the time, which was rapidly growing.

A perfect place for a new citizen of Civcraft to make a name for himself.

Once he arrived in Lazuli, he, blizzxx,</div></div>

Nate arrived at an interesting time in Lazuli's history. War was afoot as a Lazulian splinter group known as</div></div>

Nate was not in Lazuli long before he would make a name for himself in the blossoming Republic.

The complete history of the war is a subject for another book, but this is where Nate would distinguish himself as a notable</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Lazulian.

On the 5th of May, 2012, the Pumpkin Jacks along with a group of hired mercenaries known as Second Cell attacked Lazuli, pearling many of the citizens including the head of state at the time, SomethingSaucy,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 40</a><div class="page-content">and most of the current Lazulian Council.

They were able to successfully hold the city and repel counter-attacks from Lazuli's allies for several hours.

A few days prior to the final attack,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Nate assisted in establishing the first Lazulian snitch network around the city. This would help tremendously when the Jacks would launch their attack.

Nate would be involved in defending his pirate ship against the Jacks, along with</div></div>

The war was over, Lazuli was defeated.

Nate almost left the city at that point, but no doubt he was now attached to his first real home in Civcraft.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 40</a><div class="page-content">form the Maester Alliance, which is still around to this day.

This makes NateMagic a technical founder of the Alliance but the true extent of that is open for debate.

Later on, Nate would come to disagree with what Maesters Saucy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 40</a><div class="page-content">and Ttocs had done to the Citadel, even threatening to burn the flags housed in Maester Ttocs' Hall of Nations.

Nate had become disillusioned with what Civcraft had become and his distaste for the Anarcho- Capitalists was now</div></div>

NateMagic sold them weapons and armor</div></div>

It's up for debate whether or not they actually purchased them or if Nate simply gave them to HCF.

Nate maintained his innocence as a simple seller of goods with no alternate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 40</a><div class="page-content">intentions.

However, I can tell you that Nate wanted the destruction of the Ancaps and wanted to force Ttk2 (praise be unto Him) to end the First Era and begin the Second Era.

He felt the server had stagnated under</div></div>

He maintained his innocence as a simple arms dealer using the free market, but very few people came to his side.

His reputation never really recovered, even after the HCF fiasco died down.</div></div>
