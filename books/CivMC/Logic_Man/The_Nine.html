<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 47</a><div class="page-content">It is a well-known tale, the tale of the Pumpkin Jacks uprising.

Almost no one knows the full story though, the driving force behind the Jacks.

The organization that created the idea of the Jacks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The organization known as the Nine.

In this book I, NateMagic will tell you what actually happened in Lazuli.

I will reveal the Nine and some of their members.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I will show you some of their true intentions, and leave others for you to realise.

This book is a look into one of the most secret societies of CivCraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 47</a><div class="page-content">To start off we should go from the beginning, the founding of the Nine to the end of Lazuli.

The Nine was founded by a group of like-minded power hungry individuals who all shared the same goal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 47</a><div class="page-content">This goal was the complete and total control of all events within CivCraft.

From staged wars, to total slaughters of innocence.

They silence the voices of those who speak out and realise what is happening.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 47</a><div class="page-content">They use their administrative powers to ban those whom oppose them.

The group was formed while CivCraft had just began.

They would infiltrate towns and push their members into positions of power with in these CivCraft societies.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The three most popular and well known members of the Nine are NoxyD, Foofed, and Ttk2.

They all decided to choose different societies to infiltrate and then eventually control.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Foofed chose Columbia and quickly made friends with Rdhayes and wrote up a constitution with him.

The citizens of the newly formed Columbia recognized Foofed as a fearless warrior with infinite sight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Foofed was the law, is the law, and always will be the law of Columbia and CivCraft. NoxyD chose to infiltrate and take over the semi- monarchy of Lazuli.

He would gain followers then turn on the town, only to have one of his members still infiltrating.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 47</a><div class="page-content">This member would then be crowned king of Lazuli.

Ttocs_is_awe was his name, his role was to wipe the blood off of NoxyD's sword and pretend as if there was never anything there.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Ttocs would paint NoxyD as a loveable man that you could not attack, and NoxyD would act the part 100%.

Last but not least the ringmaster, Ttk2. Ttk2 would cleanse the subreddit where information was shared between citizens of CivCraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 47</a><div class="page-content">He would moderate and keep any opposition silenced.

He would swing the ban hammer at anyone who attempted to say no to his immense power, anyone who attempted to challenge his god-like powers with their own.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Power is not all that makes Ttk2 though, he is also extremly clever, he founded an underwater city called Atlantis.

The water pressure alone is enough to brain wash the masses into doing whatever you tell them to do.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 47</a><div class="page-content">He called his mindless zombie followers AnCaps. They accepted this pet name graciously. 

These poor souls story is for another day.

Now onto the story of the rise and recreation of Lazuli.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Lazuli was founded by SomethingSaucy, a highschool student.

The story starts when NoxyD and fellow members of his clan arrive in Lazuli and settle down.

From this point on NoxyD and his friend Matticus_Rex plot to take over Lazuli.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Their strategy was solid, they would capture this poor grade 12 student and hold him hostage.

The plan was that NoxyD's clan would set up a distraction through-out town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 47</a><div class="page-content">They would then set off the distraction which was a truck load of TnT when SomethingSaucy logged in.

NoxyD would then take advantage of the town's panic to go and capture SomethingSaucy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Ttk2 ready with his ban hammer and Matticus_Rex ready to dismiss anything heard and convince all of CivCraft that it was completely false and impossible to prove, the plan was set into motion.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 47</a><div class="page-content">It was going well until Ttk2 had to go to the bathroom, at this point Mindscale logged in.

Mindscale saw NoxyD's clan setting up TnT all over town. 

NoxyD now in a panic, Ttk2 absent and the news spread like a wild fire.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 47</a><div class="page-content">NoxyD set off the TnT before it was all in place and fled the town with his crew.

At this point Matticus_Rex and NoxyD were furious with Ttk2 for leaving at such a vital time during the operation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 47</a><div class="page-content">This now meant that Matticus_Rex and NoxyD would need to reformulate their strategy.

One day a new group of young middle school aged boys came to the server. 

Their group was known as Infinius.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Powerless, and new looking for things to destroy Matticus_Rex quickly snatched them up.

He told them he would allow them to do anything they wanted, and give them all the necessary equipment to do it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 47</a><div class="page-content">On one condition, that they would completely disarm Lazuli. 

They agreed.

NoxyD and the Nine created a set of undetectable modifications to a client that would allow them to lag the server while they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 47</a><div class="page-content">were online and they would be unaffected by it.

Ttk2 turned a blind eye to Matticus_Rex's little pets for a good week.

Then Infinius acted, they went through Lazuli and dug into everyone's chest stealing all valuables.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Ttk2 provided them with information on which chests to dig into and told them how to dig in properly so that it would not look as if they knew exactly where the chests were.

They ignored this and for that Ttk2 was not happy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The Nine told Ttk2 to calm down, and to just shrug it off. Infinius was a valuable tool for the Nine.

While this was true, you never cross a member of the Nine.

Ttk2 knowing that it was not in the right to allow them to disobey him, he lifted up</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 47</a><div class="page-content">his ban hammer. Lugging it over his shoulder he walked over to the group and swung it at all of them, instantly sealing them all with in another dimension.

It was too late for Lazuli sadly though.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Infinius had already annihilated any forms of defense the poor city could manage.

NoxyD taking full advantage of the situation offered to negotiate with Lazuli.

Lazuli hot headed and angry of being robbed by criminals</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 47</a><div class="page-content">who used god-like powers to do it none the less declined any form of negotiation.

NoxyD sat in delight with a smile ear to ear, he was going to allow them to hand over their town, but now he had a reason to go on one of his killing sprees.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Lazuli believing that NoxyD's men too had been effected by Infinius did not forsee the future.

Almost all of Lazuli completely upset with Ttk2 for allowing such a crime to happen, left this world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Taking their lives before NoxyD had the chance too, unknowing of the future of the other poor souls that still resided with in Lazuli.

The next day NoxyD and his men geared up and strolled into Lazuli.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 47</a><div class="page-content">They butchered every man woman and child hiding in their homes from him, running in the streets.

They were all hacked to death, souls extrated, their corpses wreaked of foul magic.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 47</a><div class="page-content">NoxyD the butcher told all of his men to bring him the souls of the departed.

He then brought out his final playing card:

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Ttocs_is_awe.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

Ttocs was a long term member of the plan to take over Lazuli.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 47</a><div class="page-content">He gained the trust of all Lazulians. NoxyD placing Ttocs_is_awe with the rest of the Lazulians made them all feel as if he was one of them not one of NoxyD's men.

NoxyD then summoned all of them and told them to break themselves free.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 47</a><div class="page-content">He then left Lazuli letting Ttocs do the rest of the work. 

He then left Lazuli letting Ttocs associate with the poor victims of NoxyD's twisted murderous pleasures.

The final part of the plan was to convince all of CivCraft</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 47</a><div class="page-content">CivCraft that Ttocs_is_awe was indeed a valid leader of Lazuli. 

After that he would need to convince Lazuli to forgive NoxyD, and convince the rest of CivCraft that they forgave him as well.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Ttocs created a pseudo agreement with NoxyD that involved total forgiveness from both parties NoxyD's and Lazuli.

This was the darkest and most pathetic day for Lazuli. To be trampled on, then to have your leader be part of the crew that destroyed you.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 47</a><div class="page-content">On top of all of that, to not even realise that your new leader was a member of that crew!

Many members of the Nine took part in the dismemberment of Lazuli.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Though they appeared to be on both sides to confuse the general public of Lazuli and CivCraft. 

Lazuli has been forged a new under the leadership of NoxyD.

The Lazulians have been renamed the Pumpkin Jacks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I NateMagic, refuse this new title.

I am a Lazulian.

This is only one documentation of the Nine's work. There are many more, I encourage my oppressed brothers and sisters to write.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 47</a><div class="page-content">To spread knowledge of their evil organization.

All of those who have been effected by the Nine rally together, and make known the horrific tale of the Nine's work!</div></div>
