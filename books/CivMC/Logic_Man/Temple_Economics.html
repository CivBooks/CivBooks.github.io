THE EVIL OF PRIVATE PROPERTY
Many often decry money as the source of all evil, but in reality it is private property that spells the demise of the spirit. Lesser beings who squander themselves in private property neglect to understand</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 52</a><div class="page-content">the manifold spiritual dimensions of the ultimate wisdom of the Ape form.

VEXLIC ECONOMICS
The traditional economic system of supply and demand as pushed in classical economics fails to model the modern economic system. In which excess supply can be produced due to high levels of automation and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 52</a><div class="page-content">factory production, along with imports and exports of all needed goods, supply can always meet demand. As such notions of scarcity and distribution do not apply, as they are but myths created by Moloch worshippers to throttle the economy. No, instead</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 52</a><div class="page-content">the modern economic dispute of the 21st century is about
THE DIVISION BETWEEN GOODS AND SERVICES.
A modern economy must divide itself between goods and services. This is the essential understanding granted to us by Vexlic modes of reasoning and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 52</a><div class="page-content">theology.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 52</a><div class="page-content">GOODS, such as widgets, items, inventory and supplies, represent one key sector of the economy. Often associated with the lower Vexlic castes, they help provide the brick-and-mortar basis of the modern Vexlic economic system.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 52</a><div class="page-content">SERVICES, such as obligations, labours, provisions and duties, represent the other key sector of the economy. Crucially, services utilise goods and allocate them as needed to provide economic growth and spiritual enlightenment. The higher castes often</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 52</a><div class="page-content">concern themselves with the allocation of services in a Vexlic economy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 52</a><div class="page-content">CHAPTER THREE
MONETARY FALSEHOODS
Any economy based on a monetary system is inherently flawed. Vexler teaches us that material goods and spiritual services provide all economic growth, and that beyond these are lies. As such we can attempt to model where</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 52</a><div class="page-content">currencies lie on the economic spectrum. As they do not fit the concept of goods (they represent a value beyond their material purpose) nor services (they have no purpose but how they are applied, similar to a good), they cannot be modeled within the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 52</a><div class="page-content">dichotomy, and as such should be rejected.
Scholars and students should note that this precludes a Vexlic economy from adopting and minting its own currency, but does not preclude a Vexlic individual from themselves holding and trading in currency. Indeed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 52</a><div class="page-content">if the overall quantity of goods and or services can be increased, the provision of foreign currencies should not only be allowed but welcomed as a means of enchancing the prestige of the Vexlic state.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 52</a><div class="page-content">CHAPTER FOUR
THE TEMPLE ECONOMY
The "Temple Economy", or in ancient Sumerian texts the "Palace Economy", or in Tibetan texts "Pagoda Economy" describes the modern form in which goods and services are allocated.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 52</a><div class="page-content">To minimise squander and squalor, goods must be centrally reserved in a stockroom or warehouse, and monopolised by the state and/or sovereign, depending on the governmental form. Citizens may utilise these goods through their individual services</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 52</a><div class="page-content">to provide for the economic growth of the nation. As such no individual's "wealth" or "value" can be measured, merely their productivity in the provision of services.
Attempts to draw parallels between the Temple Economy and a command economy are futile,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 52</a><div class="page-content">as a command economy relies on central planners and decentralised actors - a Vexlice economy utilises central allocators and central actors. There is no delineation or decentralisation, all goes through the Temple.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 52</a><div class="page-content">CHAPTER FIVE
TYPES OF SERVICES
While goods can easily be divided by their kind and nature (eg, 'agricultural' 'mineral' 'mechanical', or just 'wood' 'wheat' 'stone'), services cannot be so easily divided. Fortunately, study of the Professor's early texts</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 52</a><div class="page-content">reveals the main division. It should be noted that there exist services that defy this division, but for the purposes of this text as a Basic study, can be ignored.
The primary category of services are LABOUR services.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 52</a><div class="page-content">Labour services in generally reprsent the dumb allocation of goods as directed by a central allocator. For example, the construction of a highway, the digging of a mine or the deforestation of an area. In short, labour is a key component of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 52</a><div class="page-content">Temple Economy.
The secondary category of services provided are INTELLECTUAL services.
Intellectual services provide the key component to help direct and manage labour services. For example, intellectual services may</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 52</a><div class="page-content">design a major infrastructure network, then utilise labour services to actually facilitate the construction of this.

A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF MARXISM, CAPITALISM
The ideological dispute of the 20th century can accurately be framed as the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 52</a><div class="page-content">battle between Marxism, the ideology favouring Labour, and Capitalism, the ideology favouring Intelligence. Vexlic Economics rejects this dichotomy, instead viewing it only as a subsection of the greater economic contradiction that is derived from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 52</a><div class="page-content">dispute between Goods and Services. As such, Vexlic Economics concerns itself with the reconciliation and cooperation of the Goods and Services to help provide national economic growth and spiritual enlightenment.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 52</a><div class="page-content">CHAPTER SIX
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Though some in earlier Vexlic literature have advocated an autarkic economy on the basis of Vexlic philosophy, modern study believes that trade is essential to help grow a Vexlic economy. The introduction of goods and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 52</a><div class="page-content">services from foreign, even non-Vexlic economies is generally a net benefit to the Vexlic system.
Nonetheless, the Temple Planners must remain wary of the aluring powers of trade. Trade itself can still help develop a Vexlic economy,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 52</a><div class="page-content">but should never substitute the development of internal Goods Production and Services Provision.
Note that trade should still be conducted with the purvey of the Temple Economy, directed by Central Allocators and managed through</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 52</a><div class="page-content">Vexlic principles. Equally, trade cannot be a wooden horse for private property to be introduced to the system.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 52</a><div class="page-content">CHAPTER SEVEN
THE POWER OF SPIRIT
Economic growth as previously described requires a combination and balance of goods and services. Nonetheless, though, a Vexlic economic system also requires phenomenal levels of spirit and will to continue the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 52</a><div class="page-content">economic growth that will sustain national prosperity.

Through rigorous study of the Vexlic Texts along with meditation and other reflective paths, an enhancement of personal will and spiritual compellance can be achieved,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 52</a><div class="page-content">which will enable a sufficient level of behavioural change to increase the Vexlic growth.
Those who are unable to abide by the need for powerful spiritual levels should be relegated to menial, low intensity work, utilised more as slave labour rather than</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 52</a><div class="page-content">a powerful Vexlic planner would.
Nonetheless the collective will too poses a role, and the more willful among scholars has a dutiful job to ensure that collective will is enhanced.
The means by which a Vexlic economy can orient itself to</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 52</a><div class="page-content">CHAPTER EIGHT
BUNS AND GUTTERS
The goods needed to increase growth are manifold and multiplicituous in category, as detailed earlier in this text. Nonetheless we can perform a basic study of the division in a national economy between two particular goods,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 52</a><div class="page-content">'buns' as in bread buns, and 'gutters' as in steel gutters.
Buns represents the civilian consumer good production which is oriented towards enhancing quality of life of individuals. Meanwhile gutters represents the national heavy good production designed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 52</a><div class="page-content">to long-term increase production.
In all cases, gutters must be preferred. The national economic growth comes first, and squandering resources into enhancing quality of life and on pointless consumer goods is indicative of spiritual degradation and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 52</a><div class="page-content">Molochian influences.
The gutter economy should be nationally directed, provided goods and services to help grow, and granted the means to help implement gutter-policy throughout the nation.
Extrapolate this to all industry from mining to rail to farming.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 52</a><div class="page-content">CHAPTER NINE
AUTOMATION
Vexlic planners should be VERY wary of automation. The Vexlic economy is significantly structured around the allocation of goods and services: crucially, the national economy comes first in this equation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 52</a><div class="page-content">Automation promises to help overhaul an economy by providing goods and services for free: but beware. Every automation system itself potentially eliminates a good and services chain within the economy, threatening to obsolete parts of the economy which</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 52</a><div class="page-content">once were vital to continued economic growth.
Automation is deeply rooted in Molochian systems, and as such scholars ought to be wary.
By no means is it to be avoided, as it can provide excellent components of economic growth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 52</a><div class="page-content">But the materialistic end goal of abolishing all goods and services through automation must be avoided. Such a path is designed to corrupt the spiritual body and the mental being of scribe, scholar and all between.</div></div>

CONCLUSIONS AND REFLECTIONS
Basic Temple Economics provides an economic blueprint for national development like none seen before. While designed for Vexlic societies it contains wisdom and knowledge applicable to nearly all societies.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 52</a><div class="page-content">The original economic texts issued by Ray Vexler in the Proto-Human era have since been lost to time, reconstructed by the oldest scribes and scholars who transmitted their information orally.
