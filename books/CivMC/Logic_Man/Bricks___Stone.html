The citizens here greeted me cheerfully and offered me a small plot of land upon which to live.

I graciously accepted the offer and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 33</a><div class="page-content">proceeded to build my manor. A simple house, but not without small comforts.

Made primarily out of cobblestone and wood gathered from the surrounding forest, it offers me a safe haven from the terror and violence of the outer world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 33</a><div class="page-content">I have a nice view of the eastern sea, and the mornings are nothing short of spectacular.

I have become accustomed to this town, newly named Lazuli after the precious material found in a mine underneath.</div></div>

I also have some plans for a public building... I will have to see where my visions lead me.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 33</a><div class="page-content">My dream has finally become a reality.

A library sitting atop a tower now rises above the town of Lazuli.

The process of collected the stone, wood, and books needed was a long one, and many</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 33</a><div class="page-content">of the books in the library remain blank, but it is finished.

The other citizens of the town were so impressed that our de facto leader, SomethingSaucy, bought the northern quarter of the tower for his own personal use.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 33</a><div class="page-content">True, it leaves less room for books, but the pay was good and the honor itself is worth the lack of shelves.

I have placed an enchantment table facing south, in honor of the ruins of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 33</a><div class="page-content">trading city of Rift.

While I have yet to visit the town, the principle for which it stood is very similar to that of our own town.

I can only hope that Lazuli learns from Rift's mistakes and as a result is the better for it.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 33</a><div class="page-content">I had one of the most life changing experiences today.

I was mining in a system of tunnels and misstepped into a pool of lava.

I felt my body burning and charring as I struggled to escape, but despite removing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 33</a><div class="page-content">myself from the pit of lava, my body was beyond repair.

I lay on the stone ground, allowing the darkness to take me, positive I had seen the last of my days.

But as soon as I felt my body slipping away, I felt my mind and soul</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 33</a><div class="page-content">flying through the air, and before I knew it, I was waking up in my bed, as if it had only been a bad dream.

Unfortunately, I knew for a fact that it had been real, for my armor and other normal possessions were gone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 33</a><div class="page-content">And I could feel the faintest trace of heat rising from my skin.

Alas, I had died, but by the grace of some god I was allowed to return to this world.

            :: :: 

However, I quickly fell into a deep depression.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 33</a><div class="page-content">I had always myself to be... invincible, unbeatable.

To have my body be so easily destroyed was a grounding experience.

I took to wandering the forests to the south, searching for zombies, spiders, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 33</a><div class="page-content">other monsters to kill.
I was a wreck of my former self.

However, during one of my walks, I stumbled upon a strange sight: a lone wolf. I had never seen such a beautiful creature.

I offered it a bone from one of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 33</a><div class="page-content">skeletons I had killed, and it began following me around.

I have decided to name him Tiberious.

He shall be my companion for as long as he wishes. He definitely lifted me from my wretched state.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 33</a><div class="page-content">A few days ago, a man arrived in our town.

He was a wealthy man, and being impressed with Lazuli, made an inquiry about buying an apartment.

Unfortunately, being a small town still, we had no such buildings.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Instead, I offered my services as an architect and builder.

He took one look at the Sapphire Library and accepted my offer.

Giving me a few specific outlines, I began contruction on this large seaside house.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 33</a><div class="page-content">However, in the midst of my work, we got word from the Rift that a known criminal  had entered the area through the Nether.

We quickly retrieved our weapons and armor and prepared for a fight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 33</a><div class="page-content">SomethingSaucy and Lenicis make the trek to Rift and saw the criminal off.

After reporting his location to a team hunting him, we allowed ourselves to relax and breathe.

Trouble was not gone, however.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Not much longer, a pair of bandits entered the town and, as I slept, killed Lenicis and three others.

One of the bandits was killed, but the other got away in the ensuing chaos.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 33</a><div class="page-content">These same bandits returned a few days later with a third member, but we were ready this time.

We received a tip from the Rift and by the time the trio arrived, we lay in ambush, ready to strike.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 33</a><div class="page-content">As the bandits crossed the last hill near Lazuli, we fell upon them like wolves.

Two were slain almost instantly, while the third, badly injured, made a getaway by boat.

However, his escape route was predictable,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 33</a><div class="page-content">and by the time he returned to the Rift, several of our AnCap allies were waiting for him.

A short battle ended the life of the last bandit.

During the thrill of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 33</a><div class="page-content">of battle, I admit the bloodlust within me rose up, but after the adrenaline wore off, I must say: I prefer a life of peace over that of a warmonger.
