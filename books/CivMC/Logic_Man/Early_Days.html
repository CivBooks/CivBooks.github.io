 I ended up not leaving Saucy Manor behind. 

 The original Manor burned down along with my dog, Sir Barks.

 A new Saucy Manor was built on top of the ruins and that ended</div></div>

 I didn't realize at the time, of course.

 I was set on moving off as I had done before with Fort Saucy <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>(discussed more thoroughly in History of (+,-))</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 30</a><div class="page-content">but I ended up staying to meet up with my brother, Cooliocrow.

 My brother and my other friends including tomhid100, lenicis, Ttocs_is_Awe, and ryker13 ended up joining me as well and we as a group made up the founding group of Lazuli.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 30</a><div class="page-content"> In my journal I also mention going through a ruined village. 

 This village was located roughly near 1000, -4000. It was an NPC village that was annihilated in the early days of the server.</div></div>

 I don't know why I decided on Rift as I sure as hell didn't know whether it'd take me 1 hour or 1 week to get there.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content"> From whatever it was be it the subreddit or the wiki, Rift intrigued me.

 I was so excited to finally see a city in Civcraft, after spending such a long time rummaging about.

 I arrived a few days after the infamous 'Fall of Rift.'</div></div>

 There was only one resident there when I arrived and he was busy fixing things on the surface. I really wish I could remember his name.</div></div>

I went about 300 or so blocks to the north where I found a neat lagoon nestled in between a jungle</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 30</a><div class="page-content">biome and the ocean. I thought it looked rather nice so I set to work building Saucy Manor.</div></div>

<span class="fmt9"><span class="fmtcode">§9</span>I, SomethingSaucy, found this lake on the way from Rift to another area to scavenge. 

This was when the original Saucy Manor was built.</div></div>

Anyways, the town wasn't called Lazuli until recently once there were 5 people <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>(Discussed more in detail in the Citizens Manifest)</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> <span class="fmt9"><span class="fmtcode">§9</span>living in the town.

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
 By the time I wrote this, Lazuli was officially a city.

 It was just the founding group at this point.

 I believe I mostly wrote this short book as something to put</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 30</a><div class="page-content">in the new Sapphire Library which Ttocs had just completed.

 I don't discuss it here, but the name of "Lazuli" was decided unanimously after lenicis, Cooliocrow, and myself found a massive Lapis vein under the town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 30</a><div class="page-content"> This was prior to our visit to Columbia, which led to our numbers increasing.

 It was also around this time that we as a town made our first reddit post, with pictures of Lazuli and information on how we did things.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 30</a><div class="page-content"> Since I was the first there, I became the 'de facto leader' as Ttocs said. This led to me being known as "The Lazuli Guy" by many people including timmy123180.
