<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Jun. 6, 2012. I join the server. 

I head to Columbia as my friend told me that was the place to be on civcraft. 

I meet characters such as jackalopee, Cutlasso, and gu3rilla. I first do some work for Cutlasso. Stand up guy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Lets me keep any valuables I find. He had me clearing land that was on a gold vein. 

Then I continue in that kind of work, clearing a large chunk of land forgu3rilla.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 39</a><div class="page-content">While clearing, I talk to stuckinarut and Jru247 in chat, and a plan is born to create the Columbia Theatre Company. This company is now my focus for what will be the rest of the month. 

I also get a property from Skywalker on the north side of town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 39</a><div class="page-content">The next day I come on, my house has been griefed and a sign is present. "This property belongs to Timmy123180." 

This is when I had my first interaction with Foofed, who I had heard terrible things about, but was all-in-all a helpful guy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 39</a><div class="page-content">The plot dispute was resolved, and Timmy became my next door neighbor in Columbia.

At this point, I don't think I really left Columbia. 

I occasionally went to Rapture by rail or swimming, but the locked portal made it difficult to travel.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Instead, I worked on the theatre where I could, tried to make a measly living, and wrote a script for a play to be performed at the theatre.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 39</a><div class="page-content">During this time, there was a movement in Columbia to reform the government, specifically to have a stronger judicial system. 

There were concerns about indefinite imprisonment.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I was part of the reform group, which included other members such as Magmarizer. This "Justice" party would later lead to the city of Populi. 

But as a party, we had planned to win offices in the Columbian government to institute our reform.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 39</a><div class="page-content">10 minutes after we let the sitting government know in mumble, all hell broke loose. 

This is where My story concerning the play I wrote and the justice party intertwine at a single point, the collapse of the Columbian government.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Stuckinarut was now considered a violent threat to Columbia, many of the actors we had cast left the city, as well as a large amount of citizens. 

We were scared of anarchy. 

The arts fell apart with the State.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Magmarizer, myself, TySidd, and FeelsGoodMen established the city of Populi. 

I was now versed in Nether travel thanks to Cutlasso for first showing me the way to Kizantium, then hpoom for just creating everything.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Before establishing Populi though, I has interested in moving into Jack's hold. I did some labor for them to pay for property. NoxyD was a really cool guy. 

However, I was only going to buy one of their cheap properties, which they were slow to sell.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Before they offered the properties on the market, there was the whole incident with the Fourth Reich. 

In response, I made a reflexive post about "witch hunts" on this server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I called for people to stop blaming all members of a group for the crimes of a few. 

The jacks, however, took this as an attack against them. 

I never did get a chance to purchase land in the Hold.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 39</a><div class="page-content">But back to Populi. Populi was a newb-haven basically. Cheap property, free amenities, and was centrally located. 

The other founders sort of faded away, and I took a slight power trip.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I just pocketed all the money from land sales, started making executive decisions in the absence of a constitution. 

At one point, I had a dispute with Foofed that went to arbitration. He placed a snitch under Populi's portal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 39</a><div class="page-content">After the Columbia fiasco, we were wary of his intents, so I asked him to remove it. 
This ended up being ruled in my favor. 

I still take pride in defeating Foofed in a property dispute.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 39</a><div class="page-content">One day, while in Populi (which was already in chat range of Liberty), I started hearing conversations from a different group of people calling their group "Avalon."

I would learn that
this group was a monarchy led by kingr8.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 39</a><div class="page-content">After boredom with Populi, I decided to join. I suddenly had things to do again.

We hosted events at the giant tournament.
We expanded both in construction and in membership. Our main mission was building up resources for preparedness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 39</a><div class="page-content">(As a side note, since about my 3rd week in Columbia, I've made all my money in xp sales.) 
In Mercia, i had access to a blaze grinder. 

I gathered so much xp in that month.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 39</a><div class="page-content">In the kingdom of Mercia, the city of Avalon, I became friends with masterful921 and nimajeb3. 

I already knew bravescot5, my friend who introduced me to the server. I was also introduced to StrangerDanger.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 39</a><div class="page-content">He had the best intentions, and was a great member. But he always seemed to rub you the wrong way. 

Early on, bravescot and I plotted to pearl him eventually. However, Stranger was the first of any of us to be promoted in the Kingdom, to get his own town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Kingr8 assigned me to go work with Stranger. While I respected Kingr8, I always managed to find something else to do instead. 
However, as summer drew to a close, I decided to put CivCraft on a hiatus to focus on school. But I wanted to go out with a bang.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I sponsored a tournament in Avalon with prizes of emerald blocks and diamonds. I had 21 emerald blocks, which was quite valuable. 

This tournament was, for the most part, my goodbye. I also donated some emerald to Jru247 for his new theatre project.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Then, I decided I needed something else to make sure I wouldn't log back in. 

I decided to get myself pearled. 

And I knew exactly how to do it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 39</a><div class="page-content">In Avalon, we had storage lockers for emergencies. 

I logged in, gathered my prot IV, a sharp V, and a ton of damage potions. I logged out inside the room. I then got in mumble.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I told Stranger that he needed to get my locker open, that I had forgotten to unlock it. 

I waited until he was in place, then just afk-ing. I logged in, quick ambush. I had pearled Stranger.
He was quite pissed
at me, for obvious reasons.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I went to Rothbard, announced, "I am a criminal! I pearled Stranger for no reason! Pearl me!"

Their response was, "Eh..."

I finally got one to pearl me, then give the pearl to Stranger.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I thought it was set. Just to check, I logged in again a few days later. I was free. 
I still think Stranger accidentally freed me, but he still says it was intentional. Either way, I had Masterful pearl me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Fast forward 4 months. I just enjoy Christmas, don't care much about school anymore, decide to come back. Masterful has been pearled by HCF. 

Basically, I won't get out of the End until he does. So, I sometimes logged back in the end.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 39</a><div class="page-content">People complain for being there a few weeks. I say, "I'm an old jailbird, been sitting here for four months now." 

It worked, until someone recognizes me as the guy who voluntarily got pearled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Then I got freed, and am now wondering about with leather boots and an iron chest plate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 39</a><div class="page-content">The largest fail project that I forgot to mention is the Church of Holy ttk. 

Still standing in Populi, I believe. Check it out. 

It was my attempt at starting CivCraft religion.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Pete and Dolan always outshines the Church of the Holy ttk, but I am still partial to ttk as the Civcraft Deity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 39</a><div class="page-content">This is my part of CivCraft history.</div></div>
