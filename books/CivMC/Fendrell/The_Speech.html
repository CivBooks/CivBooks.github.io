I love the people of Icenia City for helping me win the last election, brilliant voter turnout. Some say the most there has ever been but I am still looking into that, but folks it's clearly self evident. I love the Icenian people and together we will...</div></div>

This event will be a bit different than last events, today I'm not just giving a speech but a clear policy address on the steps that we need to take to beat back our enemies and restore Icenia to its former glory.

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...I'm just after coming back from my visit to the leader of Volterra. We had many productive discussions and believe me when I say this but that man loves Volterra. Not nearly as much as I love Icenia but we don't need to talk about that right now.
Do we need to....</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...talk about that right now? We won't talk about that right now.
So anyways folks we are under agreement that the illegal movement of Estalians towards Icenia is very very harmful to both nations and to Volterra. It's important for us to protect our local economies and...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...I've talked about the great contributions that Icenia has provided to the server and let me tell you folks, there are so many contributions. I was barely able to list them all out but in the end I managed to do it, believe me. For a moment I thought I wouldn't be able to but I was able to and...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...Overall it was a very productive and substantive conversation with Volterra and trust  me when I say this but it will go on for awhile. There are some big problems that we need to solve with Volterra and believe me when I say this but we will solve them. In the end we're both...</div></div>

We are going to develop a very special relationship with Volterra. But it's also going to be a fair relationship. Some might say too fair but we want fairness...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...So far only Icenia has been fair to other nations and that has to change. Trust me when I say this, we can't keep being fair to others while getting nothing in return. That's right, we get nothing in return for our fairness folks and that has to change. Icenia has to change...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...As the first step to fixing Icenia we need to deal with the Estalian problem. We must change the Estalian-Volterran border and we must do it quickly, sadly there is no other way.

Estalians have many iceroads across Volterra leading to Icenia and...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...sadly the Pavian media does not report on this. The Estalian trade situation is worse than what anybody has realised, Estalians won't talk about it because they are making a fortune out of cheating Icenia and Pavians won't report on it because they've been paid to cover it up...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...Today I'm going to tell you the truth.  The fundamental problem of the Icenian economy propping up the global economy and getting nothing in return. This serves the needs of outside forces such as Pavia Bank or Raven Rainments. Trust me when I say this, this is not a good...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...position to be in.

Let me tell you who this position does not serve. You, the hardworking Icenian people. This position does not serve you. When people talk about connecting rails, copperifying infrastructure, open borders, pearling amnesty...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...they fail to mention  the negative impact this has on the Icenian economy and the Icenian nation.

I have many brilliant minds in my administration and let me tell you, they think Estalia is smuggling Icenian goods into Pavia and Exyria. Folks you might ask...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...why that is a bad thing? Let me tell you  folks the cold  hard truth, the world is a mess. Instead of buying high quality Icenian made goods from Tusk Armoury, other nations are buying used weapons and tools from Raven Rainments. That's right, they choose to buy Raven Rainments...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...And where does Raven get its tools and armour? They get it from Tusk Armoury, but they smuggle out old and used equipment folks. This is terrible for the Icenian economy, terrible for the average Icenian. And the Estalians? They don't just let it happen, they make...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...sure it happens folks. That's right. They want this to happen. And believe me when I say this but it's happening and it's happening a lot. Everyday Estalians smuggle used equipment through their iceroads into Pavia and Raven Rainments. And why do they want this to...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...happen? It's quite simple folks. They earn a cut of the sales, and Raven makes a lot of sales.

And you must be asking right now, doesn't Tusk and Icenia earn some money from this? Well folks we do, but not as much if we sold our good quality...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...items directly. Raven buys used items at a steep discount and this has to stop. And believe me when I say this, it will stop. I will stop the Estalians and the Exyrians and the radical Pavian media that's covering all of this up.

Believe me folks when I say this, but we...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...already have a plan in place to stop this. We have many plans, brilliant plans. Nobody makes better plans than me. Y'know all of this was actually part of my plan to bring back Icenia, to bring back our economy, to bring back our jobs, to bring back our land and our people. That's right. It's all part of...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...a plan. Our plan. This is why when I come into office again we will be stopping ALL Tusk sales and exports. That's right we are stopping all Tusk sales and exports to stop the illegal smuggling but that's not all folks.  We have agreed with Volterra that those Estalian iceroads...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...need to be dealt with, and we need to deal with them soon.

This is why we need to build a vault. And not just any vault, but the biggest vault in the history of the server. And we need to build it fast. It has to be built and it has to be big, bigger than Icenia. That's right...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...it has to be bigger than Icenia. Folks you might be asking what is going to pay for this or who is going to pay for this. And I'm telling you folks, we will make the Estalians pay for this vault with all the money that they have stolen from hardworking Icenian workers. That's right, we will build a vault...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...and Estalia will pay for it. I'm telling you folks this is the only way to start fixing the issues in our nation, and there are so many issues. Issues caused by the other nations, issues caused by my political opponents inside of Icenia.

But it's not enough...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...to just build a vault, folks it's not enough. We need to deal with the radical Pavian media that is manipulating everyone against Icenia. You might be asking why they might be doing all of this? It's simple folks, they hate Icenia. They have always hated Icenia and they will always...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...hate Icenia. This needs to be stopped and they need to be stopped. The Pavians need to be stopped, and I will stop them once I come into office. Believe me, we will stop Pavia and their Pavians and their Icenian-hating media. That's right. We will stop Pavia. Pavia is an awful place...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...and Pavians? They're awful people. Bad bad people believe me. When Pavia sends their people they don't send their best, trust me I would know. Y'know I once had to make a withdrawal from Pavia bank and this teller lady god bless her tells me she isn't online right now...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...and I say alright I'll come back later. You see at the time I didn't need to make a withdrawal but when I come back she isn't there and I ask her what's up and she tells me they fired me. That's right, they fired her because I wanted to make a withdrawal so I got to  Pavia city to meet...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...another teller and they tell me there are no tellers online at the moment. So I wait and while waiting I walk around and let me tell you folks. Pavia city? Brilliant city, beautiful. One of the best cities in the world, not as good as Icenia city but they got close. So close. But then I ask myself some...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...questions right. Where did the money for this come from. And I'm thinking, when was the last time we checked our trade balance with Pavia. I call Shadno and  he tells me, would you believe this, that we don't keep track of such things. That's right, Pavia city was built with...</div></div>

I love the Icenian people, I love Icenia believe me. Y'know every good person wants to be an Icenian.

So sometimes I would go to the federation, walk around, take in the sights. Beautiful sights, very productive walks and sometimes I have a talk with the locals and would you believe it the federatoon has an assembly. I didn't klnow that did you know that...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 49</a><div class="page-content">...So I would start going to this assembly but there are no people there because of timezones but then one night I go later than usual and I see people at the assembly and would you believe it but they live under an emperor. Maybe we should do that for Icenia...</div></div>

ZeroQL stands up from his seat and says...</div></div>

That's right folks the federation wants to be Icenian but some bad Pavians won't let it happen.

And now the federation can't do anything without Pavia allowing it. Trust me this is a bad position to be in, one of the worst deals in history.
