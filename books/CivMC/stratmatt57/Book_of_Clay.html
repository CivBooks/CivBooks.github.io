  The Origin

Wandering throughout the lands beyond our world, our Lord Etahn found a beautiful land. He watched this place from afar, observing its people go about their lives. Toiling the land, waiting long hours</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 25</a><div class="page-content">hoping their crops may grow in order to see another day.

Etahn pitied their way of life. Putting in such great effort for a reward they may never see, due to the threat of conflict and war these people faced constantly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 25</a><div class="page-content">How could they tolerate living this way?

Despite this, He admired these people for their will to create and their perseverance even when faced with the most trying of circumstances. Etahn wished to help them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Polemic II: The Gift

One day, Etahn began to see great swathes of land disappear. He found these people He admired gathering, awaiting the end of their world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Despite the end of this world coming, Etahn knew a fresh world would take its place, and that these people would return with it. And so the world ended, and as Etahn knew, a new one took its place.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 25</a><div class="page-content">These people once again began to return to their previous lives. Building cities anew, toiling their land and facing the hardships they had before. Etahn saw a man sitting beside a pool atop a hill. He went to him and talked to this man.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The man taught Him of their world and pleaded Etahn to help. Etahn told the man He would imbue his essence into what these people knew as Clay.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He said this Holy material would bless the land with life and fertility, helping the land and its people prosper. He said all those in this land would recieve His Gift, but those that followed His teachings and worshipped Him would be blessed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">...and those that deserved His wroth would be cursed.

Our Lord dipped His hand into the pool. Pillars of Clay rose to the sky as the pool poured out His Holy waters, to flow their way throughout the world to spread His blessing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">And with that, the world was forever changed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Polemic III:
The Claymandments

I: Accept me as your God, giver of this gift that has blessed your land. Worship me above all else.

II: Do not desecrate that which is Holy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 25</a><div class="page-content">III: Words are wind, those that truly wish to prove their devotion to me must commit themselves to the Clayjj Pilgrimage. Journey to this place where I have given My gift unto your lands.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Meditate by its pools, wash yourself clean with its Holy waters, and add a piece of blessed Clay to this Holy site.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content">V: I know that war will always exist in this land. I know your victories will be great and many, so I ask that you do not destroy the wonders of this world created by its people and your enemies - no matter how small.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">VI: I ask that you do not permanently punish or imprison those who oppose you or wrong you. They are simply led astray by their inner demons and deserve a chance to see the way of the Clay.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 25</a><div class="page-content">A chance to give themselves unto me and have their souls moulded anew
- if they prove themselves worthy
of it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 25</a><div class="page-content">VII: Your kind may always have those that lead and those that follow, for better or for worse.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 25</a><div class="page-content">As long as this is so a leader shall care for his followers as he would care for himself, and a follower shall repay this care with their loyalty and respect.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 25</a><div class="page-content">VIII: Conduct yourself with
poise and light heartedness.

I have seen what there is far beyond this world. You are not alone nor are you the most important beings in existance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 25</a><div class="page-content">This is not a cause for despair, but should act as a way to put yourself in perspective with the world. Treat others kindly because anything else is a waste of time and energy that could otherwise be put towards fun and love.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 25</a><div class="page-content">IX: Your lands and its people have faced strife and will face more that will cause them to become wary and fearful of their fellow man, seeing a threat in each of them. You must never surrender to these fears.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Never deny another the right to be your guest unless you know they will act dishonorably in return or must otherwise. Let them into your halls, eat your bread, warm by your fires and never bring them harm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 25</a><div class="page-content">It is a betrayal most grave for guest and host to harm each other.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 25</a><div class="page-content">X: Live your life free. I give you this gift not so you can exert your control over nature and amass its wealth, but so you may live a life free from the chains of hardship and labour. Free to live a life you yourself desire.</div></div>
