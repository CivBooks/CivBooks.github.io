    The paranormal is
a field which I know
very little about. This
book is not about the
paranormal, but about
those who believe,
those who pursuit,
those who honor,
those who pray, to
Herobrine.</div></div>

    I've come into
contact with many
such people over the
past few years. Some
are like-minded
scholars investigating
the lore of this
specter, while others
are religious zealots
awaiting orders from
their divine ruler.</div></div>

    In the early days
this scene was full of
misinformation and
false leads. People
such as Copeland
claiming to have proof
of an apparition,
claims of summoning
rituals, others even
claiming to have
"called" Herobrine at
3AM.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 44</a><div class="page-content">
    Nothing of value
was found in these
early days. Once
interest began to
wane we began to see
the enthusiasts and
the zealots. There
where many groups
calling themselves
<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>The Cult of Herobrine</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>,

among the masses.</div></div>

unfortunately too
late. Abandoned by
their leadership,
forgotten by their
congregation, the
ruins of this church
was a archive in
shambles. I spent
weeks piecing
together what I
could.</div></div>

    With each visit I
began to see items

no longer the only
church goer. I left a
sign asking for any
visitor to contact me,

contacted by someone
going by the name of
Clocky.</div></div>

    Clocky was one of
the original members
of this group. My
suspicions were
confirmed, this church
believed Herobrine to
be a "Good Guy".
Among many things we
disused they also
mentioned a book. This
book would later
become an obsession
of mine.</div></div>

their own church.</div></div>
