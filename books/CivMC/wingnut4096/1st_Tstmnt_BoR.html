It is based upon the hard fact that Ra and Anubis are the only true gods because of their essential role in the creation of life. Without the Sun, the Earth would have never existed, and furthermore, without</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">the Sun, we would have no light or energy. The Earth is the base that life plants its foot upon, and without the Earth and its resources, life would be impossible. Because of this, we disciples worship Ra, the God of the Sun, and Anubis, the God of the Underworld, or, for our purposes, the</div></div>

You may ask yourself, why does the caged bird sing? The answer is let's get back on topic. You may ask yourself, why do we combine Ra and Anubis? Well, the answer to this question is not so straightforward. You see, the prophecy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 10</a><div class="page-content">speaks of the day when Ra and Anubis will combine into one essence: Ranubis. The only question now is why and how does the prophecy know of this sacred event? Well, the reason why is very simple. Truly enlightened disciples, after many days of prayer and meditation, have realized that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 10</a><div class="page-content">because of complicated phenomena, there is no other option but to combine Ra and Anubis. It's as simple as that. To answer how we know all of this, it is because of a time loop. Ra and Anubis are bound to combine, and we know this because it has already happened.</div></div>

When debating with a scientist, one may falsely accuse Ranubism of being “inaccurate” according to their “counter examples” based on “science”. Well let me ask you, what is this "science" based on? Proof. But do they have proof</div></div>

When debating with a believer of a false religion, like pastafarianism, the</div></div>

Though there is much more to Ranubism than can be explained within a human's attention span over the course of a single sitting, what is presented to you in</div></div>
