-------------------
1. Everything, within
the world and without,
from the flesh to the
soil to spirit itself is
contained within the
one single point that
we call the Universe.
2. The Universe
encompasses all
because it is all.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">3. That which is good
and evil alike, which is
light and dark, warm
and cold, animate and
lifeless, is all once,
for they are all the
Universe.
4. As the Universe is
the divine totality of
all things, anything
born out of the
Universe is imperfect,
for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">it is only a fraction of
that which contains all.
5. From the Universe
came that which we call the Architect of the World. Being only a
fraction, the Architect
could not possibly
make use of the Wisdom present in the
Universe. 
6. In its ignorance, the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Architect believed
itself to be all that
was.
7. The Architect of the World created the
world to satisfy its
own vanity. Because
the Architect was not
perfect, the world that it made is not perfect.
8. The Architect
created the land and the seas,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the jungles and deserts, and the mountains and
valleys. It populated
the world with plants,
animals, and people to
serve as its subjects.
9. Being an imperfect
world created by an
imperfect Architect,
the inhabitants of the
world are doomed to
suffer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Truths, Book II
-------------------
1. The plants and the
animals and the folk of the world would not
truly be able to
experience anything
were it not for the
All-Spirit.
2. The fraction of the
Universe left over
after the creation of
the Architect is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">known as the All-Spirit.
3. The All-Spirit is
wisdom, mercy, and
justice. The essence
of the All-Spirit is the
essence of the soul.
4. Pitying the
creatures of the
world, the All-Spirit
breathed fragments of soul into the
inhabitants of the
world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">5. The senseless
automatons created by the Architect were
filled with the wisdom
and energy of the
All-Spirit, and were
able to develop as
conscious and moral
beings.
6. Animals were given
smaller fragments of
soul, and humans were
given larger souls.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">That is why humans
are more conscious
and moral than animals.
7. Every person is
partially physical, and
partially spiritual.
People are flesh and
soul. The flesh gives a sense of body and the soul gives a sense of mind.
8. The body is destined to falter</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and die, returning to
the matter it was
created from. All
bodies return to the
Architect as matter.
9. The soul cannot die,
for it is a fragment of
the All-Spirit and
separate from the
created world. Every
soul will join the
All-Spirit beyond the
World.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Proverbs
-------------------
1. Do not stop looking
until you find.
2. If you plant weeds,
you get weeds. If you
plant nothing, you get
weeds. If you plant
crops and abandon
them, you get weeds.
Only by planting and
tending crops do you
get vegetables.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">3. Life happens
wherever you are,
whether you make it
happen or not.
4. Many things that
seem threatening in
the dark become
welcoming when we
shine light on them.
5. Those who act most
virtuous in the open
are the most bankrupt
in spirit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">6. You must never give
in to despair. Despair
puts you in line with
your lowest instincts.
Hope is the food of
the soul.
7. The best way to
help oneself is
sometimes to help
another. Even a small
amount of help from
another is a great
blessing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">8. Where there is a
beginning, there is
also an end.
9. Within every person
is peace and justice.
Virtue lies in letting it
shine out, and vice lies
in keeping it shut in.
10. Protect your kin
like they were your
own flesh.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">11. The purpose of
life is whatever it is
put towards.
12. Wisdom is like water.
You can only draw so
much from a single
source before the
well goes dry and the
land is beset by
drought. 
13. When you come to a crossroads, take the good path.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">14. It pays to keep
more than one iron in
the fire.
15. When the war-cry
echoes throughout the land, it is time for
peace. When the call
for peace thunders
across the hills, it is
time for war.
16. Things are what
they are.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">17. Nobody is absolute
ruler of anything but
their own tower.

and nights agonizing
over what to wear.
19. To truly love
someone is to meet with their spirit.

in poverty nor wealth.</div></div>

Both will find the sea.

honorable things is to
admit your own faults.

everything, you're
good at everything.</div></div>

-------------------
1. This is the speech
that Ostracod gave
when he enlightened
the people of Yoslan:
2. The essence of the
Body is Matter, and
tends towards serving
its own worldly needs.
3. The essence of Soul is Wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">4. The Soul being made
of Wisdom, is what
makes people capable
of kindness, love, and
learning. 
5. The ensoulment of
humanity by the Spirit
of Wisdom was the first and last act of
Kindness in the
universe. For without
her Wisdom, we would
be living dead.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">6. The only agents in
the Universe capable
of Wise acts are
people, for animals
have lesser souls
than humans and
unliving things have no souls at all.
7. A person is Soul
and Body, while a
fungus is entirely
Body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">A person is capable of good and evil while a fungus is mindless and can only act out the basic will of its Body.
8. I have not come as
a lawgiver, but to lay
down the principles of
a morality based on
the Soul. I give you
the principles of
Wisdom thusly:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">9. A good person is
someone who does
what a soulless
creature would be
incapable of doing.
10. A soulless
creature would hold
no obligations to its
clan or its community.
This act we shall not
follow.</div></div>

creature would refuse to aid the poor and weak. This act we shall not follow.

creature would tread
upon its</div></div>

wealth and power

follow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">17. I have shown how
the nature of a
person is both Body
and Soul. I have shown how a creature that is entirely Body would be devoid of any values beyond power-seeking.
18. What I have not
shown is the nature of a being entirely of
Soul.</div></div>

entirely consisting of
Soul except for the
Goddess of Wisdom
herself. However, each one of you can seek to become more Soul and less Body.
20. You must strive to
slough off your mortal desires and embrace the virtues of justice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">21. You must pray to
the Spirit of Wisdom.
Pray amidst the earth,
to remind yourself of
your own mortality.
Pray amidst the air, to
remind yourself that
your soul must be
open to the Universe.
22. Pray when you
deem it necessary and
especially when you</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">think it is unnecessary. Pray
freely and pray
intently.
23. Free your soul
and Wisdom will take
pity on you. Through
prayer the Wisdom
within each of us can
be strengthened. 
24. The potential for
good lies within every
person.</div></div>

-------------------
1. This is an account
of the Dialogue
between Ostracod the
Enlightened one and
the King of the
Westlanders.
2. The King pointed his
finger at Ostracod
and accused him:
"There shall be no
cults in Norlund!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">3. Ostracod
responded: "How could
it be a cult that
offers the Universal
Truth?"
4. The King laughed
and said, "Is it not
every cult that claims
to have the universal
truth?"
5. "You are mistaken,"
said Ostracod,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"For I do not claim any particular thing that is true universally, but
the Truth about the
Universe."
6. "Fool," said the King,
"You claim to know
Truth when you deny
that God is a being of
light!"
7. "How can Light be
more Godly than
Darkness, Ostracod</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">responded, "When both
Light and Dark are
alike part of material
creation? Would it not
follow that the
Architect of Darkness
also created Light?"
8. "You deny then, that
the sun is the home of
God?"
9. "Yes, said Ostracod,
for that which created the Sun</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">also created the rest
of the world."
10. The King asked,
"You preach of a
single creation, yet
you teach that the
material is evil and the
spirit is good. How can
this be?"
11. Ostracod
answered, "You are
correct in that the
material and spiritual
are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of the same Universe,
but the Spirit and the
World are two
separate aspects of
that Universe. The
Architect of the
Material World did not
create the Soul, nor
did the Goddess of
Wisdom create the
materium."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">12. "Heresy!" The
king accused
Ostracod, "You
profess a belief in two Creator beings."
13. "Do you not as
well?" asked Ostracod.
"You make yourself a
distinction between
light and darkness." 
14. Ostracod then
demonstrated how the
God of Light that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the Westlanders
worshipped was merely the God of the
Material. He
demonstrated that the
secondary force in
the Universe was not
Darkness or Evil, but
Wisdom. It is Wisdom
from which the Soul is
emanated. The King
called off his Crusade.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Apotheosis
-------------------
1. Ostracod had reached the age of 55 when he spoke to the Yoslanders again:
2. "I have imparted unto you my Nonniq Gos [Spiritual Knowledge]. Go forth and expand on it."
3. Then his Body died
and his Soul joined 
Wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Temple Building
-------------------
[The following is not
treated as scripture,
but rather is a set of
notes on Marquis-era
temple construction.]

1. As the body is
mortal, churches are
set into the ground so
that the floor is below
the land level.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">2. As the soul is free,
churches have no
windows or doors, and
wind is permitted to
flow into the building.
3. As the desires of
the body are base,
churches are to be
sparsely decorated.
4. As prayer is
private, churches are
to fit a half dozen at
most.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">5. As the needs of the
Soul are imminent,
churches should be
spread across all
populated areas.
6. As even a simple
building can be a
luxury, worshippers
are permitted to pray
in a ditch if a church
is not avaliable.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">7. As neither the Soul,
nor Wisdom, nor any
prophet, nor the
Universe can be
represented with any
one symbol, churches
are to be free of
idols, icons, and
symbols. 
8. As prayer is a
sacred activity,
churches are sacred
buildings.</div></div>
