This is a firsthand account of Hjaltland's Classic Start, by past user Jett891.
===================

When Civclassics first started up back in 2017, I joined for fun. It was a spur of the moment decision based off of the cool videos</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">I had seen from the first few iterations of Civ. I was mainly intrigued by the prison pearl mechanic and how the server was mostly anarchy-based aside from that. I spawned in a swamp biome. I don't remember the exact coordinates, but it was far from where Hjaltland decided to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">setup their base. I lucked out, however: someone named Dovah spawned near me. We talked a bit and I was invited to their Mumble (or was it TeamSpeak? I can't quite recall) server to talk, which is how I got into Hjaltland. At this point, I was simply along for the ride. Dovah and I traveled to where</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">the leader of Hjaltland, BlueSylvaer, told us to go. The journey itself took around an hour which is the time that I learned a lot about the nation of Hjaltland and their general plans for the server. Being comprised of mostly veteran players from older civ servers, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">was very out of the loop. They explained to me (very quickly) to get specific mods like Journeymap to catch up with everything, read up on various resources to understand how factories work, and told me some funny (and not so funny) stories about the history of Civ. A few</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">other notable members of the faction were Frensin, Thoth (who I believe plays here somewhere and goes by a different name), and... that's all I remember, unfortunately. I mostly spent time mining for resources and chopping down trees to supply Hjaltland with the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">resources necessary for the nation to thrive. I think I was what people would call a "grinder" more so than anything else. I enjoyed hanging out with everyone involved, however.

One of my favorite memories was when I was talking to Blue and he was talking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">about alternative accounts. I pulled up an alternative account I had that I renamed to "BlueSylvear" (the E and the A in the name were switched) to mess with people on the server. I logged in on this alternative account and found a nation at the top of a giant mesa biome.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">This nation was none other than Yoahtl. It was described to me as "a group of people that have Tulpas", which was interesting. Tulpas are, to put it simply, an imaginary friend that you give a material form by extreme belief. It is a paranormal concept and many people thought it was just a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">bunch of nonsense. I thought it was interesting that this group was entirely categorized by that one belief, at least when it came to Hjaltland's descriptions.

Skipping a week or so later, work on Hjaltland's vault began. It seemed quite</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">major from the perspective of someone like me, who had never really built anything to such a scale. I was told we would need "a thousand obsidian, minimum". I began to work immediately, but only ended up getting 50 or so. I was reassigned to clearing the land</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">around the vault. It was a pretty simple job, but when I was a kid my brain didn't want to do it. I slowly drifted away from CivClassics, only visiting twice. I joined a month after the incident with Dovah. I asked everyone how the nation was going and they explained the situation to me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Some sort of insiding had happened. I didn't get many details as I wasn't considered a full citizen of Hjaltland anymore, but looking at CivWiki it was a pretty major incident. I stopped playing on CivClassics sometime in July 2017.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">In 2021, I was bored. I was remembering all the fun I had in CivClassics and decided to log back in. It took a bit as I had to match up versions and reinstall JourneyMap, but it was worth it. I spawned directly into the bunker of Hjaltland. I was interrogated by Thoth, who later</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">remembered me and let me out of the bunker without any issue. I toured the unfamiliar city and felt happy that something I had contributed to, even a tiny amount, had become something so great.

Do I regret not playing on CivClassics?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Yes, but it's nothing to beat myself up over. I enjoyed the time I had played CivClassics on with Hjaltland and will remember it for a long time. I wouldn't go back and change my actions in the past to stick with Hjaltland forever, though. 

I wonder how everyone is doing now.</div></div>
