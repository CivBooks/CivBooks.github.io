        Book IV

===================

Throughout the course of the server's history, many nations have come and gone. Joja has played a variety of roles for its neighbors, which this book will explain.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">One of Joja's first neighbors was the Leibniz Confederation, a small group of players who claimed Joja Isle, among a great many other islands in the area.

Other islanders would also settle nearby, though only Leibniz maintained claims in the area.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">North of Leibniz's claims was KOEL, a nation of PVPers lead by their god-king, Error-L. 

Though infamous for server drama in the past, KOEL was able to form a friendly relationship with Joja, resulting in the latter establishing a milk and cookies bar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Ultimately, however, KOEL crumbled from the inside on account of multiple betrayals from its high-ranking officers. Its brutalist structures still remain in the area now claimed under the Arsenio Pact.

Though peace reigns, Joja's neighbors are missed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Other entities would also go on to have meaningful relations to Joja before fading away from the server.

The Hyperborean Federation was one such group, as well as the southern city now known as former Venne. Joja's shops in these locations still remain.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">As old nations fade, however, new ones are born. 

Joja's formerly southern neighbors in old Venne would eventually migrate north, settling on a neighboring island that has since become a thriving cultural center of the island chains.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Heading further east, new relations were made with Nara, and Joja's CEO was eager to adapt the brand to the country's Japanese aesthetic. 

A new Joja Kiosk was built in Shiroyama, the largest city currently within Nara, on 8/12/2022.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">This occured during the Generic war, a conflict between former Rhode Island and Estalia that spiraled into multiple casualties well outside of the main countries involved.

Rampant raids from players like Clutch were common in Nara.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Despite these tensions, Nara thrived, and Joja had the privilege of being part of it.

Not only would Joja go on to develop a full summiting course for Nara's 2023 Olympics, it also expanded its offerings to a full convenience store.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">To this day, Joja's relations with Nara remain one of its most important, benefitting greatly from Nara's economic prowess and diplomatic support.

In turn, Joja continues to enrich Nara's cultural landscape while assisting citizens with its services.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">This author notes that strong international relationships are critical for small nations on the server.

In a community where some argue that small nations shouldn't exist at all, finding allies willing to teach and support newfriends is very important.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Beyond support, however, small nations benefit from truly international-freindly policies.

This includes investing in and assisting with the projects of larger nations, which often requires the establishment of reliable trade routes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Without the trade of affordable XP, diamond tools, and other critical resources, smaller nations struggle to have any impact at all on the international community.

Through diplomacy, however, independent entities like Joja have prospered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Joja continues to develop and expand far from its island base, with the CEO hopeful of new, large-scale projects in the future.</div></div>
