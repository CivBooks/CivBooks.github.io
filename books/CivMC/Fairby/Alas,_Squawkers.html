Ballad of Sorrow

I was living peaceful,
thought a friend might
come show

Sharing all my wheat and making bread dough

Knew someone might come steal what I had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Then I saw my tent where you left a dent

Any chance of friendship torn and rent

So why did you kill squawkers?

Already took my crops and murdered sheep</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Why did you have to kill Squawkers?

Sinking my dreams into the deep

Wheat I can replant and trees grow back

I've already forgotten your attack

An act as pointless as it was cruel</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Using violence as a tool

We could've been friends and shared a toast

Now my loyal little friend is sad compost

Why did it have to be Squawkers?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">You had all my wood and coal

What did you gain by killing Squawkers?

There was no point there was no goal

Is that why you traveled out at sea

To ruin innocence with ignominy?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">You didn't have to be a bully

We could have made a super fun story

Instead you left without a word

Cold and callous, it's absurd

I'm so sorry for you, Squawkers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">You only wanted to be a friend

I wish I'd been there for you, Squawkers

It's too sad this is how it ends

But I'll go on, it's the only way

Tomorrow brings a brand new day</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">I'll keep on helping everywhere I can

Making memories, that's the plan

Joja Island, this is where we stand

Making new friends in a beautiful land

I won't forget you, Squawkers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 9</a><div class="page-content">No, you didn't die in vain

Please watch over us all, Squawkers

Someday I'll see you once again</div></div>
