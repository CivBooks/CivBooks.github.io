CivMC can be a wonderful experience where players enjoy the company of friends and the satisfaction of large-scale projects coming to completion. However, CivMC can also be a stressful,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">at times even painful, experience. During difficult situations, it's more important than ever to look after your mental health and take some time to calm your mind.

To help you in this endeavor, I will walk you through a common breathing exercise.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">To begin, find a comfortable place to sit or lie down. 

Focus your mind on a peaceful location, a place that feels safe and quiet. Imagine a high mountain peak, perhaps, or a boundless ocean shore where the waves roll in and out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Bring your awarness to your breathing, focusing your full attention to the way your chest rises and falls with every breath.

Take a deep breath through your nose, letting your lungs expand as far as they can.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Hold that breath for 5-7 seconds, slowly counting out the time in your mind. One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

Then, slowly exhale for 8 seconds, mentally counting out the time. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Continue to inhale, hold your breath, and exhale in the same way, focusing on each breath.

Let your thoughts wander away from the things you are worried about: lingering anxiousness over the past or concerns of the future.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">For this exercise, focus only on the present moment. Keep your mind in that safe place, perhaps with the aid of some soft, relaxing music. 

If it's difficult to stay focused, keep your mind fixed on counting, thinking only about the tension in your chest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">as you inhale and the relaxing of your muscles as you exhale.

You can also use mental mantras to help focus your mind and add positivity to your thoughts. As you inhale, mentally say, "inhaling peace and calm."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Then, as you exhale, mentally say, "exhaling tension and anxiety."

This type of exercise is called resonant or coherent breathing, and it only takes a few minutes to have a profound effect. It's often used to help with bouts of anxiety throughout the day</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">and can also help increase cognitive function.

By taking a step back and allowing your mind to calm, you can clear your head and improve your focus for the difficult and complex tasks you perform every day. Try this exercise for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">about five minutes and see how you feel. Planning just a little time every day to step back from a project and set yourself firmly in the present moment can make a meaningful difference.

A great mentality to have when practicing this form of meditation</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 15</a><div class="page-content">is that of tea ceremonies held in the East. The particular concept that comes to mind is Ichigo Ichie, which translates roughly to "one opportunity, one encounter," or "for this time only."

Although this refers to tea ceremonies, in</div></div>

Each moment we experience will never be experienced again in exactly the same way. We have once chance to live out each moment of life,</div></div>

When you focus your breath, calm your mind, and place yourself firmly in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 15</a><div class="page-content">now, you devote yourself to the proverbial teacup, drinking deeply of experiences that shall soon fade into the passage of time.

Therefore, it's never a bad idea to allow yourself the time to enjoy the flavor of life, no matter how simple it may feel.</div></div>
