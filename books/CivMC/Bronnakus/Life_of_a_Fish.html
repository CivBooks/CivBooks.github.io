A look into the Life, Times and History Of 
        JesstheFish

or, an autobiography


     written by
            JesstheFish
Transcribed by Bronnakus</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">The life of JesstheFish, while not a long tale, is an interesting one. It begins in October of 2019, when she first spawned in the CivRealms server. She explored for a while, read her starter book, and rather quickly learned she could shout so loud that the whole world</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">would hear her. 

Using this newfound ability, she spoke her first words: "hello".
Aresot, the King of a burgeoning Varathia, heard her should and extended to her an offer of citizenship in his empire. She quickly accepted, and there built the first iteration of a recurring</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">building - the tavern known as the Maenad Tavern. It was a simple building - in fact, she didn't even realise she could actually brew alcohol until after the build was complete. But once she learned how alcohol worked, she was infatuated with it. She sought membership with the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Varathian Brewers Guild, headed by TTastic and Albyrt, and was given a quest - if she could brew a beer, a wine, and a liquor, she would be granted apprenticeship under the Guild. 

She set to work immediately. She brewed first lager,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">then a nice pisco. While it would take longer, she created vodka as well. 

A week later, in November, she grew bored with life in Varathia. It was a nice life, but dull. She grew tired of even the idea of the Empier, and sought a new system, a system which as yet</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">did not exist. So, she sailed off, and settled the site that would become La Commune d'Athena, beginning with the Fort Eve, on November 6, with some help from ICOR. Cabo and esorscher would later join her, and the three of them would build La Commune into a nice settlement. However,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">all good things must end, and after a month that grew plagued with problems, so too did the Commune.

So, where was Jess to go? She couldn't return to Varathia. However, when esorcher left, he offered her something good - citizenship in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Wheatistan. This was something she considered, and an offer accepted by her. After a vote to grant Jess citizenship, she moved to Wheaton and set up a second version of the Maenad. This version was an open-air bar, and while it produced a good amount of alcohol, never sold</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">any. After a confusing week, she left Wheaton for the city of Alexandria. 

Alexandria was itself a new city - it was only a couple weeks ago it had been founded, but it had expanded rapidly. It was the very day that Alexandria declared its independence that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Jess moved to the city and planned to establish the third iteration of the Maenad. However, tragedy struck when, during construction, the mule Jess had used perished. It was widely believed today that the mule was murdered by a raider, but who is unclear. Either way, the horse</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">had perished. And so, Jess decided a new name for her open- air bar, the Mule's Head Tavern, named after the unlucky beast of burden. She sourced a mult from CivCorp and it was the mascot. 

From here, she made many achievements. She wrote multiple</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">books, discovered types of wine, and was a prominent member of Alexandria, so much so that she was granted the Bureau of City Planning.

One day, Jess was a fair bit peeved. It was a situation she'd been frustrated with since she gained her apprenticeship - she</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">wasn't really a member of the Brewer's Guild. She wanted that title badly, but there was a nigh impossible task for her to face - She had to create a completely new drink that no one had discovered yet. This was a challenge that she, and many others, were wholly unfit to accomplish, and there</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">were future problems as well - notably, the idea that eventually, no more drinks would even be capable of discovery. She immediately sought an audience with Albyrt on the situation. After much deliberation, it was decided that maybe the membership requirements should be toned down - and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">that Jess would be an official member of the Guild. 

She gained her bureau, built a ship in the harbour and around writing of this book had even become a dual citizen of Yamato. She has since renovated the Mule's Head into a completely new design, and is now</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 17</a><div class="page-content">a prominent member of Alexandrian society. 

Such is her life so far. Perhaps not the most adventurous life, but a fulfilled one nonetheless.</div></div>
