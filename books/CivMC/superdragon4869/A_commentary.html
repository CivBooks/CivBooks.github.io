<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 10</a><div class="page-content">    This is a commentary on the state of politics in the nation of Icenia for the month of October, 2023.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">I joined civ in the beginning of October and Icenia took me in with open arms. At first, I saw them as the kind beacon of democracy in the western hemisphere. However, the state of politics has me worried, at the time of writing. A Gang Shi traitor, Bebek, stole key assets from GS,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">and built a bunker. A large one at that. GS demanded he pay for his crimes, but no such thing happened. When GS began hunting him, he fled to Icenia and became a resident. Eventually, he was found in the Fempire, Gang Shi's ally, and he was pearled for his crimes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Icenia did not take kindly to the murder of Bebek, and issued travel advisories to GS and all of her allies in retaliation. Perhaps it was not related, but around the time a new military branch was founded, the Vespers. Anyways, after this the Pearl Street Herald conducted an</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 10</a><div class="page-content">interview with Gwua. The reparations paid by Icenia after the Butt-SECS war were not used in the betterment of GS, rather, they were used as decorative blocks. Icenia did not particularly care. Icenia had gone to court and was found guilty of obstruction</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 10</a><div class="page-content">of free and fair elections. Two campaign announcements were deleted by President ChrisChrispie. However, despite this, his actions were "justified" by the court under the constitution. "Patriotism" (or more fittingly, nationalism)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 10</a><div class="page-content">is also on the rise this October. Any opinions that the Icenian senators don't all collectively agree on are argued against, and Icenian politics have become somewhat of an echo chamber. To recount so far, the president of Icenia was found guilty on charges relating to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Obstruction of free and fair elections, but was let off. Nationalism is on the rise. And finally, the political situation is hostile to a nation that is collectively seen as a threat, and politics have become an echo chamber. Simply put, as of the 11th, things are lookin rather authoritarian.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Today, Friday the 13th, Icenia completed several vault bastions for "Security", which could possibly mean that they know something about a possible threat, or are preparing just in case. War seems somewhat distant, but not an immediate threat (yet).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Well, I lied. Talks of war are happening in servers and in main chat. October 16th, by the way. Nobody knows why but its Pearl on Sight for any GS or GS related civilian right now. Not war, exactly, but open hostility. Tiantang is opening its doors to refugees.</div></div>
