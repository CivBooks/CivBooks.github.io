A world of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 24</a><div class="page-content">danger and unfamiliarity.  We settled in a dark forest, filled with mobs and capped with a dense, inpenatrable canopy of leaves blocking every hint of a sky we soon forgot.

It was in this new world that I started on one of the most arduous</div></div>

The brave new era of civcraft brought about many innovations in gameplay, plugins, politics, etc, some of which were well recieved, but many of which were universally hated.

For a time, Mount Augusta lie dormant.  Civcraft had gone offline and it's playerbase had scattered to a variety of different servers and other games such as Rust.  I found myself in a position where I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 24</a><div class="page-content">could finally disinvest from my passion for e-legos and focus on real life.  I would drop in to servers from time to time and say hi to friends, or hop in the mumble to chat with Augustans past, but I had completely given myself over to the idea that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Augusta would live and die with Civcraft and that I would be the last in the long string of leaders that had come before me.  My legacy as mayor would be that I kicked and clawed as Augusta and the rest of the server slid slowly into the grave.  At the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">time, I had no idea how resiliant and strong the spirit of Augusta truly was and it would be another month or two before it became aparent to me.  A while after the server ended, I started to recieve messages from Augustans telling me that they wished</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Augusta would continue.  These messages came not only from my friends and fellow officials in 3.0 Civcraft, but also from 2.0 and 1.0 Augustans.  A small group of us discussed the idea of a continuation and settled in a narrow and fertile valley in the ++</div></div>

I had no idea how people would react to us taking the name and running with it.  I expected</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 24</a><div class="page-content">pushback from OGs who didn't want the name to leave the server.  That never came.  Instead, we experienced a surge in population and Augusta 3D was born.  I thought I was going to be the last mayor of Augusta... and I was, but I was also the first mayor</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 24</a><div class="page-content">of Augusta, a city whose love for justice, resiliance, and friendliness trancends servers and will continue to do so as long as we hold in our hearts the principals on which it is anchored.  To all future mayors of Augusta, I leave the following message:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 24</a><div class="page-content">In your darkest hour
     when all is lost
         and you think that you have failed.

When you think that the end has come and the ride is over.

When you have reached the lowest point, look ahead because there are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 24</a><div class="page-content">more mountains to climb.      There are more valley's to settle, more friendships to cultivate.

I am now retired from my time as mayor and have moved on to other projects, but I would like to thank those who helped</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 24</a><div class="page-content">carry Mount Augusta through the darkest time, not only for our city, but for civ-style servers as a whole.  It was your unquenchable spirit that allowed us to make the transition that made me both the
last and first mayor of one of the greatest cities that has ever</div></div>
