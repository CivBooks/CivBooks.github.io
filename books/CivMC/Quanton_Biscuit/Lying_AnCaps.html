<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 28</a><div class="page-content">1. Why The Ancaps exist.

Long, long ago. Ttk made a server called 'ancapminecraft'.
It was a server created because ttk was getting bullied by leftists server hosts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Ancapminecraft was a Haven for all edgy teenagers that hate equality and actual liberty.

Notorious ancaps that joined this server are Joshua97367 and FoxmcLeod.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Then a prophet of freedom and solidarity joined ancapminecraft.
They started a guild of solidarity and equality called "The LibSoc Guild"

Ttk was baffeled and coaxed that some leftist pussy could come over to his server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The LibSoc Guild ruined his server.
And ttk used...

... the terminal.

And CivCraft was born.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">2. The Free Baby Market

The Ancaps didn't spread much in the beginning of CivCraft, they made a vagina shaft called 'The Rift'.

The Ancap virus was contianed, and all was well.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Some Leftist freedom fighters decided to get rid of the oppression and racism once and for all.
They burned The Rift and destroyed the Ancaps menace.

People thought the Ancap virus had been eradicated, but it was far from that...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Ancaps spread to once free cities such as Columbia and Augusta, and destroyed them from inside out.

Foofed "Gatzy" Timmyius went into the democratic leftist parliament and dissolved it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Oppression and racism ran rampant, and then the Free Baby Market started.

The Free Baby Market consists of inner hierarchies.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Hierarchies are:

1. Foofed
2. Matticus_Fucking_Rex
3. AnCaps
4. nothing
5. Leftists, free people and proletariats
6. transpeople, dolphins and black womyns</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Foofed rules the 
Free Baby Market with an iron fist and a golden penis, where all the penis towers are modeled after.
The Free Baby Market is made to oppress free, leftist people. And make people racist and hateful.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Free Baby Markets sells Babies that are stolen from leftist parents, those who want to teach their children actual freedom and solidarity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">2a. The Monopoly on Force and Justice

The Ancaps hate freedom, even though they act like they want personal freedom.
They disregard legitamite state rules and just run into free, sovreign nations and torment their inhabitants.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">They kill anybody trying to interfere with their "justice" and then they tell everybody that they are against "Monopolies on Force"
but they kill everybody without care. 
They know who to not kill by using their secret device;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">3. The CKC

The CKC is a cesspool of crime and corruption, it's where the Ancaps go to oppress free, beautiful people. 
They talk to eachother about the definition of definition and air, and how to oppress leftists more evil.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">In their free time The CKC likes to go to Hitlercon, a great convention for people who love oppression and hate.

One can usually find Ancaps sitting in the CKC defining definitions.</div></div>

Much like RevSci, except more oppressive and priviliged.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Tactful soon became one of the most privileged Ancap of all the Ancaps, the Upper-Admin Foofed made him an admin personally.

The Admins are the most priviliged of priviliged Ancaps, they made this secret club to oppress transpeople and proletariats more.
