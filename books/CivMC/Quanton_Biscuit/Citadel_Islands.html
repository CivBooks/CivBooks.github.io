II. Eastern Island

III. Western Island Introduction</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 26</a><div class="page-content">The Citadel Complex itself is neither old nor new in terms of the server. But the land it occupies has seen some history. There are three main islands in the area, each with its own unique history.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 26</a><div class="page-content">I. Main Island

The main island, what I call "Citadel Island," was originally found my NateMagic, at the height of the Lazulian golden age.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 26</a><div class="page-content">At this point in history, Lazuli dominated the (+,-) region holding thousands of square meters of territory.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 26</a><div class="page-content">The Republic needed places to mine, so NateMagic, a Lazulian Council member, ventured far out onto the fringes of the world to find untouched Vanilla chunks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Nate found the frozen little island and built a portal, started a farm, and opened up a mine. The mines underneath the Citadel Isles go on for an eternity. There's still massive amounts of resources down there.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 26</a><div class="page-content">If one ventures down into them, they can find remnants of old mining camps and roads. One particularly well preserved camp was one belonging to MiniBen, who set up camp near bedrock and started a small melon farm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 26</a><div class="page-content">The Lazuli mining camp never saw many people there, so it fell out of use in the days of Lazuli's downfall.

Several months later, NateMagic returned to the island with several others to build a stronghold.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 26</a><div class="page-content">This was when Nate came up with the name "The Citadel" which has stuck with the place ever since. Nate brought his entire wealth of resources to the barren land and began construction.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 26</a><div class="page-content">The Citadel Tower
was about halfway completed when Nate was forced to leave. He left the remaining task to SomethingSaucy, another former Lazulian.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Saucy had lost everything in the Pumpkin Jack-Lazuli war, when he was head of the Lazulian Republic. After that, he resigned, and spent most of his days wandering the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Before Nate left, he told Saucy to come to the Citadel and work on it with him.

When Nate left, Saucy picked up where he left off. He finished the main tower and began other projects and exploring the nearby islands.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Soon after Nate left, Ttocs_is_Awe joined Saucy's quest to complete the Citadel, which is where things are currently.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 26</a><div class="page-content">II. Eastern Island

The Eastern Island is the smallest of the islands. The name of the island is "Edgeland" as that is what is was called by early Lazulian explorers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 26</a><div class="page-content">In the days of the Lazuli mining outpost, a Brother from the Night's Watch of Castle Black stumbled upon the island. His name was "blargblarg" and he dubbed the land be called Edgeland as it is known today.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Blargblarg left only a sign and some supplies in a chest before heading off, and the island lay untouched until Ttocs rediscovered it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 26</a><div class="page-content">The main island already had cows inhabiting it, but the sheep were on Edgeland. Ttocs built a land bridge to bring the sheep over.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 26</a><div class="page-content">A little while after that, the cattle and sheep were relocated back to Edgeland, where the Citadel's farmhouse and silo are currently.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 26</a><div class="page-content">There are mines underneath Edgeland, so far a gold ore vein has been found. Further expeditions are being planned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 26</a><div class="page-content">III. Western Island

The Western Island is the least developed of the three, yet it is the largest. Remains of a settlement have been found on the island, but the only record of the place is a sign labeling it "City 17."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Other than the sign, there is signs of mining and even an uncovered dungeon, with a spawner covered in torches. The nether portal that was built there sits on top of a small obsidian bridge.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 26</a><div class="page-content">The portal itself links to the Citadel portal on the netherside. My theory on who settled there and built "City 17" is that it was also early Lazulian explorers who came to mine here.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Further diggings are underway to try and uncover new clues about the mysteriously abandoned settlement.</div></div>
