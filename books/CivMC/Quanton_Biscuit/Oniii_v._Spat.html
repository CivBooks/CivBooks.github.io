Conversely, ObtainableSpatula will not be treated criminally as a griefer but an agent of his own property as much as the IUPA. This is a matter of torts and not crimes.</div></div>

I will start with laws the defendant has not broken, then end with the obligations he must fulfill over the laws he did break.
