1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The HCF war has left
the server in ruins. IN
those ruins, however,
players have grown
stronger. We are now
seeing the rise of new
cities, new forms of
organization, and new
styles of play that
are stronger</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 48</a><div class="page-content">and more
well-thought-out than
previously imagined.
Players have survived
the violence and
thrived, and the
experiment continues.

Despite these triumphs
and the new
renaissance triggered
by the (virtually) full
release of the world-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 48</a><div class="page-content">edge vault, many
victims (and the
friends of victims) are
wondering why this has
all happened.

Clearly a large part
of the blame and
causal efficacy lies at
the feet of the HCF
members who
perpetrated violence
upon Civcraft. There</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 48</a><div class="page-content">is no doubt about this,
and this is not meant
to be a work of
apology for that. The
violence, theft, and
damage that has been
done to the server
has been on many
scales. This work is
meant to address a
single scale: the
indefinite nature of
the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 48</a><div class="page-content">imprisonments
perpetrated by the
HCF. In a
GITMO-fashioned
facility, they held
combatant, political
dissident, and
resistance fighter
alike with tight
paranoia--letting any
of them go might lead
to them being
permanently pearled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 48</a><div class="page-content">in the end. Given that
they wanted to stay on
the server, they felt
they couldn't risk
setting free their
eventual captors.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 48</a><div class="page-content">This leads us to a
natural question, which
this book is meant to
address: "Why did the
HCF garner such
paranoia? Why did it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 48</a><div class="page-content">feel necessary to
permanently pearl
Civcraftians, innocent
or combatant. Why
would they want to
remove others from
play, thus halting the
experiment?"

Clearly there are
simple explanations
here, such as "they
were in it for the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 48</a><div class="page-content">lulz" or "they are
psychopaths" or "they
simply love ruining
peoples' time". All of
these things may be
true, but there is
another partial cause
that this book is meant
to directly address:

Norms of Violence and
Imprisonment
established by AnCap</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 48</a><div class="page-content">WorldPolice Members
are partially
responsible for HCF's
harsh imprisonment
policies.

This is written in the
hope that we learn as
a community, and that
those in the future
fail to repeat the
mistakes of our
generation.</div></div>

2. Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By "WorldPolice" or
"AnCaps" I simply mean
a particular group of
players that typically
hangs out in the
Mumble channel "Cool
Kids Club" or "Bat
Cave". This includes
Matticus_Rex, Foofed,
ServerError,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Exultant, and others.
They are bound by a
loose tie to
"anarcho-capitalist"
political ideology (thus
the term "the
AnCaps") but as
NateMagic said it best,
they are a group of
"loud mouthed bounty
hunters". Thus, I will
refer to them as the
"World</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Police". They mainly
earned this term
historicall by
intervening in
sovereign countries,
often flouting local
laws and conventions.

By "HCF" I mean to
include HCF and all
splinter-factions
thereof. Clearly there
are many political</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 48</a><div class="page-content">schisms and
distinctions between
the groups that
invaded Civcraft from
the HCF. I refer to the
group as a whole
because for the
purposes of my
analysis, they serve
as a whole unit; this is
because they served
as a semi-unified
military and defense</div></div>

and Imprisonment

This chapter alone
would constitute many

many volumes, and
already there exists a
wealth on Google
documents and Reddit</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 48</a><div class="page-content">sources documenting

in producing HCF's own
indefinite imprisonment
policy.
------
The WorldPolice
sanctioned various
players in its history
with permanent (or
indefinite)
imprisonment. These
players fall into a few
broad categories:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 48</a><div class="page-content">(1) Players committing
offenses so serious
they "warranted
permanent
imprisonment". For
instance, Josh, for his
repeated and
thorough destruction
of cities, was pearled
indefinitely. Other
extreme griefers were
treated in similar
fashion, along with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 48</a><div class="page-content">large-scale thiefs.
For examples, search
the reddit for
"pearling" threads.
Examples abound.

(2) Prisoners who
owed a "doable"
amount of damages,
but who had no
reasonable way to
produce payment.
Players in this class simply owed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 48</a><div class="page-content">too much; they couldn't
feasibly play Minecraft
for dozens of hours a
week just to release
themselves from
imaginary prison, and
so they were
effectively
permanently
imprisoned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 48</a><div class="page-content">(3) Presumed
recidivists. Many cases, the
adjudicators simply
judged that the
criminal could not and
would not reform. This
subjective judgement
was used as excuse to
keep the person
imprisoned,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 48</a><div class="page-content">regardless
of the nature or
severity of the
offense.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 48</a><div class="page-content">(4) Players who were
totally unknown. Many
players kept by the
WorldPolice were kept
without reason, as
nobody holding the
pearls could remember
why they were held.
Thus, they were held
because "it would be
too risky to release
them". This GITMO-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 48</a><div class="page-content">style logic (keep them
in case they retaliate
or are somehow,
perhaps, enemies), of
course, is more likely
than anything to
produce enemies.
Besides, it attempts to
right ones previous
mistakes by sweeping
the "problem" (people)
under the rug.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Needless to say,
permanent
imprisonment became a
norm on the server
(except for the leftist
sections of the
server, who have
never until recently
even held a prison
pearl). With the
exception of
organizations such as
the Pumpkin Jacks, who</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 48</a><div class="page-content">allowed for prisoners to work for
their freedom, most
pearlings ended up
permanent. This
established a norm;
getting pearled
became tantamount to
dying, especially when
sanctioned by the
WorldPolice. No normal
player or group at
the time had the
military resources</div></div>

Rational Response to
WorldPopo Violence
Norms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When considering how
to approach an enemy,
one should consider
how that enemy might
react. Often, examining
rational response is a
good first
approximation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 48</a><div class="page-content">While people fall far
short of rationality,
people who are
capable of even a
*modicum* of analysis
and careful thought
will settle on, more or
less, rational
solutions. Regardless,
it's important to
investigate the
rational response to
the threats of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 48</a><div class="page-content">violence that was
presented by the
WorldPolice during the
HCF invasion. Despite
the clear irrationality
of certain members of
the HCF, it seems clear
that the group as a
whole would be more
likely to stumble upon
a clear-headed and
rational response.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Let me preface this
analysis with a bit of
history. As evidenced
in the early youtube
video by ApacheBlitz
("Slaying AnCaps"),
HCF members were
*discarding prison
pearls*. Rather than
keeping WorldPopo
members for
imprisonment, they
were simply</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 48</a><div class="page-content">interested in besting
them in combat.

Even when HCF
members began to
imprison players, they
were released within a
day or two. I can
attest to this myself; I
was released along
with many other
prisoners a day or
two after the initial</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 48</a><div class="page-content">invasion. I fell in battle
during the initial battle
of Augusta, but was
subsequently released
when the battle was
over.

Why were we
released?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 48</a><div class="page-content">The explanation given
at the time, and the
one that seems most reasonable, is that eath-ban norms on
HCF are much
different than the
norm of violence and
imprisonment crafted
by the WorldPopo on
Civcraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Given that
HCF death-bans are
temporary, it made
sense that HCF
members would release
their prisoners
gradually.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 48</a><div class="page-content">What changed?

HCF members were wise
to the reddit. They saw
that WorldPopo
members habitually
imprisoned people
indefinitely.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 48</a><div class="page-content">They saw
that they were under
threat of being
imprisoned indefinitely.
Given that this was a
possibility (rather than the norms they
were used to on HCF),
the game changed
immediately.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Now there was a
non-zero probability
that their players
would be *taken out of
the occasion*. Thus, if
they continued to
release their enemies
(or potential enemies) they simply created a
possibility of being
beaten forever.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 48</a><div class="page-content">This explains the
indefinite imprisonment
and the growing
paranoia that even the
innocent members they
held would become
violent. Knowing that
they had made
mistakes, they began</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 48</a><div class="page-content">to feel exposed by the
possibilities they knew
were lurking in the
shadows. They could
release the WorldPopo
or others, of course,
but they *knew* they
would be risking
permanent</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 48</a><div class="page-content">imprisonment. And sure
enough, since then,
they have been hunted down for precisely this purpose.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Given repeated play
and enough
repetitions, dynamic
systems end up in
"absorbing states" or
states where things
cease to change. The
HCF knew that
continually freeing
their competition meant risking getting themselves
permanently pearled.</div></div>

6. Conclusion

The conclusion I
believe we can draw
from this is that
extreme threats serve
no-one. Everyone has
the time and inclination
to play this game.</div></div>
