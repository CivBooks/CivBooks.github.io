Figasaur and his close friend, RabbiCroc aka Zoltan, were on the run from the Mount Augustan police. The mayor of MTA, Cityleon (pronounced city-lee-ohwn), had grown tired of Fig and Croc’s fake Jewish LARP,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 28</a><div class="page-content">endless dereliction spam, and constant harassment of MTA’s citizenry and decided that permanently imprisoning Fig was the best course of action. Fig, not wanting to spend the rest of the
server in the End (because that’s where you used to go if you were a bad little boy),</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">had arranged a deal with ChrisChrispie for safe harbor in the new nation of Icenia. All Fig had to do was get to Icenia’s claim and he would secure his freedom.

After crawling through a series of poop and pee-filled sewers, Fig and Croc made it to Icenia,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">the only nation that would take them in. Unfortunately for Fig and Croc, the stench of poop and pee would not rinse off and they would forever bear the raunchy smell of fecal matter and piss. 
They set up shop in Icenia and started doing the exact same thing they did</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">in MTA - annoying everyone in sight and pretending to be Jews.

Shortly after Fig and Croc’s escape, an MTA assassin ostensibly hired by Cityleon crept into Icenia posing as a newfriend and pearled Fig, carting the pearl back to MTAs’ vault Fort Briggs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Icenian people had not yet grown weary of Fig’s antics and being unhappy with the breach of sovereignty, protested the illegal pearling in the streets of MTA. An MTA policeman, Callum, got a little too excited by the protestors and decided that the best</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">way to quell the unrest was to detonate a 40 pound TNT bomb in the middle of the gathering. Hundreds, nay thousands died in this vicious attack and among them, the future admin SoundTech.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Seeing the streets of MTA run red with the blood of innocents and the World Police drones beginning to circle, Cityleon sat down in his $900 Gaming Racing Chair, weary and exhausted. He gave himself a moment, then let out a single tear and ordered the release of Figasaur.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Fig returned to Icenia, a free man once again. However, his freedom would not last forever…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>A Few Months Later</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

The Fig experience had grown old. Once a quirky and somewhat amusing individual, Fig had blossomed into an open canker sore that was slowly consuming Icenia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Fig, Croc, and their “Jewish Quarter” were the source of the current state of aggravation in Icenia. Like a tidal pool of shit, their toxicity slowly lapped at the shores of Icenian progress and integrity. An outburst during a VC debate had resulted in Icenia</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">being removed from the SATO alliance, and their constant blathering on the global stage had fouled relations with just about every neighbor.

Icenia had finally secured peace with our northern neighbors, Bloom, and had formed a nascent</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">defensive alliance with them and another unimportant neighboring nation. Fig and Croc were frothing at mouth with the news of our diplomatic ambitions and were actively working to sabotage the alliance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">After a long string of arguments, they threatened to leave and tear down all of their builds. This crisis was briefly delayed and Fig and Croc took a short break from Icenia to begin work on a new nation dubbed “Redditopia.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">This is the point where I, Quanton_Biscuit, the protagonist of this story, make my entrance. I had been working to establish a defensive alliance with our neighbors so that an event like the Clown Wars could never happen again. Fig and I had become rivals as soon as he realized my desire</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">to align with groups like SATO who Fig described as “World Police.”

It became clear that Fig had to be dealt with; he was constantly undermining our efforts and was breaking down the very fabric</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 28</a><div class="page-content">of Icenian civilization. I devised a plan.

I created a discord alt and reached out to DCHERO, the general who led Warlord Cityleon’s armies. I proposed an offer - I would bring MTA the pearl of Figasaur if they agreed to hold it and honor</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">the bounty that had been posted on him. Since Fig was still wanted by MTA and would be permanently imprisoned if captured, DCHERO quickly agreed.

I recruited my good friend, Lagiacrus11 and we logged into two unknown alts of ours.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 28</a><div class="page-content">We tracked Fig’s travel to Redditopia and waited for him to take the rail to 0,0 (the center of the map and considered outside of Icenia’s legal jurisdiction). Once Fig got there, I ran up and decapitated him with one fell stroke.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 28</a><div class="page-content">With Fig’s pearl now in my hotbar, Lagi and I hopped on boats and traveled towards MTA. Along the way, we were assailed. A player under the alias of “Jim Cramer” attacked us in the great ocean that separated Icenia and MTA.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Believing that this was tankbuster44 (a Hjaltaland leader who was one of the top dogs in the SATO alliance and had an alt named “Jim Comey”) we disengaged and continued traveling towards MTA.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 28</a><div class="page-content">A short time later we reached the shores of MTA and met with DCHERO and exchanged Fig for the diamond blocks and returned home a few days later.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 28</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Epilogue</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

Fig immediately blamed MTA and Cityleon for the assassination and demanded ChrisChrispie break him out; unfortunately for Fig, he had used up the last of his goodwill in Icenia long ago. He was left to rot.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Fig along with Croc retaliated by ripping down most of the “Jewish Quarter” before Fig was upgraded to a prison pearl and cast into the End. Croc fled Icenia and traveled north to the old Chanseatic State, establishing the “Epstein Bunker” where he hid.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Fig was eventually freed after more than a year in the End when MTA went inactive and DCHERO forgot to fuel his pearl. It took Fig years to discover the identity of the true “MTA Assassins.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Lagi and I had accomplished our mission: we had eliminated our main political rival, took no heat for it, didn’t have to worry about fueling him, and even got paid to do it.

All in all - mission accomplished for the “MTA Assassins.”</div></div>
