It’s dark and the room is bathed in a reddish hue, the faraway heat radiating in from the outside. The interior of the attic is damp, the floors unpolished. It is quiet, but not completely silent, for the dull, unending roar of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 43</a><div class="page-content">fire makes its way through the walls from the outside.

Occasionally, the wind will pick up, blow embers across the window and shake the sickly walls of the house. Impossible to tell whether it is day or night - how long have I been sitting in the corner,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 43</a><div class="page-content">covered in soot and struggling to breath through the unending cough?

The door from which I entered remains unopened for what lies on the other side. All around, the heat of the inferno seeps through as the world wails with the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 43</a><div class="page-content">lamentations of hundreds of dead towns and forgotten players.</div></div>

It’s a late March afternoon and the atmosphere hums with the electric bustle of activity. The swollen air of the rainforest rolls off the trees, down the walls and into the newly-founded town, where dozens of players mill around its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 43</a><div class="page-content">markets and roads. They lug great bags filled with cobblestone and dirt up the hill as others dig into the ground, construction yards covering every inch of available real estate. Skyscrapers, most of them unfinished and still covered in scaffolding,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 43</a><div class="page-content">litter the nascent skyline of the town.

Every morning I step outside, lock my doors, and make my way down the main avenue to the piano shop. The heavy tropical air lays dense with smog. A dozen chimneys billow the black smoke of burning charcoal, a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 43</a><div class="page-content">hundred factories work in unison to produce new goods. The smell of industry permeates the land. The sooty charcoal deposits build up in nooks and in crannies, on the workers’ clothes. On the windows of the houses whose owners have already</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 43</a><div class="page-content">silently disappeared.

       ＊   ＊   ＊

The month of March passes over us like a migratory bird, the year moving on through its passage towards summer. The air is slightly warmer, it's the rainy season now in the tropics and almost every day</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 43</a><div class="page-content">water falls from the swollen clouds. The puddles reflect the streetlamps at night and the rain pounds the roof and drips down the windows.

The air is stuffier now and the citizens are on edge. There is less joviality and every night the Mumble is abuzz</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 43</a><div class="page-content">with the clamoring voices of politicians and statesmen. The player who addresses the nation is hawkish. Her speeches rally the population against the enemy from the adjoining shard. They are the invaders, pearlers of the innocent, she says, those Aegians</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 43</a><div class="page-content">know nothing but warlordism and seek to destroy our way of life. They threaten peace in our land. Now the armed forces stand guard at the central plaza, milling around their bunker. I sit on my roof in the midday sun and listen to the muffled sounds of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 43</a><div class="page-content">the loudspeakers and rallies in the distance.

       ＊   ＊   ＊

March leaves us and April rolls in like the clouds that roll through what’s left of the tropical valley, long since decimated by rampant deforestation. The war did eventually</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 43</a><div class="page-content">come, and with it came conscription, signed into law to defend the nation against the Aegians.

The diamondclads come in the night, 'Concordia Defense Force' written on the back of their prot, the loud knocking echoing up and down the still roads</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 43</a><div class="page-content">illuminated by the bright glare of the streetlights. No matter how long the pounding lasts, the doors always open in the end, followed by the hushed murmur of voices, the sound of glass breaking, and muffled yells. Come morning, the house is empty and in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 43</a><div class="page-content">a few days becomes dilapidated, shuttered, but no longer cleared for demolition.

       ＊   ＊   ＊

April is finally here, but more and more people aren’t. A stroll around the neighborhood reveals a dozen shuttered houses, now</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 43</a><div class="page-content">overgrown with tall grass and vines. A fellow player is a rare sight, many stay indoors to avoid the diamondclads. More dangerous are the looters that show up near the city's walls. No one is quite sure where they came from, but their masked faces are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 43</a><div class="page-content">hidden and the tips of their arrows glint in the late evening sun.

Every day the feverishly incessant debate on the Mumble continues. They talk of dignity, of revolution, of revenge. The governments succeed each other, every coup more violent</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 43</a><div class="page-content">than the last, every new voice seemingly more alarmed than the one before it.

Yesterday, I passed my only remaining neighbor driving out of the city in his cart, his tamed ocelot by his side. He waved to me as he usually does, but I saw the look of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 43</a><div class="page-content">despair in his face as he passed by. I can’t say I blame him.

       ＊   ＊   ＊

The sharp twang of bowfire rings out in the night, the shouts and cries of combat closer than usual. I flip the switch in my darkened room, but the redstone grid is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 43</a><div class="page-content">out. The night is spent huddled close to the door, listening to the distant crackling of ricocheting arrows, until eventually the bowfire dies off and silence returns once again.

       ＊   ＊   ＊

With early May the rains peter off as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 43</a><div class="page-content">summer begins in earnest. Most of the time is spent on the rooftop, the interior of the house oppressively warm without redstone AC. The Mumble has gone quiet now. No more voices and speeches, only static. It has been almost two weeks since I saw another</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 43</a><div class="page-content">player. Not even a diamondclad patrol or a looter in the distance makes their presence known. The blackish smoke billowing from downtown for three days straight reminds me that I’m not alone in this server.

I sit atop the roof, sweating, drinking the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 43</a><div class="page-content">last junk pots from the bottom of the cooler. I watch as more buildings in the distance become engulfed by flames. The fire is out of control, the purest expression of the will to destroy.

Inside, I load up all the belongings I can fit into my pack and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 43</a><div class="page-content">stash it under the wooden paneling next to my bed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 43</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>The Road</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

The sun beats down on the pavement of the Inter-Shard Highway where cracks have begun to form. A hundred carts and carriages, strewn about haphazardly, have been left abandoned in a panic. Clothes and belongings are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 43</a><div class="page-content">scattered about the pavement, some fluttering in the wind.

I pass the road signs, 'NEW LAZULI - 1200 METERS', most already defaced with crude messages warning others to stay out. At first I peered into the abandoned carts, hoping to find something that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 43</a><div class="page-content">hadn’t already been gleaned from the wreckage, but now I just walk. In the distance, from where I came, the plume of smoke grows taller and bigger. I notice a solitary ember dance to the ground in front of me.

       ＊   ＊   ＊</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 43</a><div class="page-content">The Cross-Shard Bridge stands mostly intact. Dusk hits as I walk methodically among the burned husks of carts and horses. The singed air mixes with the whelming salty smell of the sea. When night falls upon my silent journey I see lights on the distant</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 43</a><div class="page-content">coasts, impossible to tell whether they’re lamps or fires.

Eventually, I am too tired to continue. I crawl under a cart flipped on its side as the wind picks up and blows through the hollow supports of the bridge. I listen to the roaring ocean and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 43</a><div class="page-content">moaning wind shaking the structure and wonder if it is not ttk2 bringing fury upon the world that He Himself had created and had displeased Him.

       ＊   ＊   ＊

Morning comes and the bridge stands behind me. Before me, the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Inter-Shard Highway stretches out endlessly over the wooded fields and plains. Where the horizon meets the sky the blackness of the smoke rises up to dizzying heights. I walk down the road again as the embers blow across my face. I cough, not knowing where</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 43</a><div class="page-content">to go. Only my feet lead me.

The smoke is all around. The tall trees on either side of the highway of death stand engulfed in flames, crackling in the wind, the burning embers coming down like the tropical rains once did long ago. They singe my hair</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 43</a><div class="page-content">and my arms and burn my nose and throat and lungs. The cough is constant, I walk with watered eyes and my head tilted downwards until I can continue no more. 

I stumble past a dilapidated fence, plodding across the burnt remnants of what was once a wheat</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 43</a><div class="page-content">field, its crops now cooked to charred nothingness. Signs adorned with friendly reminders to replant now smoulder in the blaze and fall apart before me.

I find myself in an old village, mercifully intact. Wandering down the main street, I bump past</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 43</a><div class="page-content">mailboxes and watch as glass from the storefronts shatters from the heat. The smoke all at once envelops me, choking me in its wrath, and I stumble through the ashes until I find the doors to a wooden house.

I crawl inside, coughing and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 43</a><div class="page-content">sniveling, expecting death, like the old street dogs of Concordia that would crawl into the drainage pipes when they felt their time had come. However, death did not come to find me, only the changing of the colors seeping through the wooden paneling.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Darkest orange gives way to the haunted ghastliness of twilight. Is it the sun falling behind the horizon, or the ash blanketing the world? Eternal night in an eternally empty server. Who else is out there? No one replied as I screamed out in chat. The</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 43</a><div class="page-content">flames lick the outside of the wooden cabin as I fall into a restless sleep.

Finally, it's time to rest.</div></div>
