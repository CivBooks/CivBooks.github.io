Small droplets of misty rain had finally begun falling from the grey sky. The clouds seemed to buckle and roll off the edge of the distant hills and into the valley, where they were now opening up and releasing streaks of precipitation</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 78</a><div class="page-content">over the loading yard.

LukeMC_98 watched from below the small awning of the main building as the ground, a patchwork of cobblestone and gravel, began to gleam and reflect the light of the late-afternoon sky. The large gate leading to the road opened and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 78</a><div class="page-content">closed periodically as horse-drawn carts entered, their great wooden wheels leaving tracts in the mud. Behind them, a handful of tall stacks towered from somewhere behind the wall, belching thick black smoke that formed a sharp contrast to the monotony of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 78</a><div class="page-content">the sky.

He heard his route being called as a factory worker walked out of the main loading doors, gesturing over to him. Luke bundled up his coat, hunched his head down and headed out into the rain. They had to yell to be understood over the loud droning</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 78</a><div class="page-content">of the compactors in the factory.

“6 DCs of dark spruce to Norvansgard?”

Luke passed over the waybill, and the factory worker studied it for a second. “That one yours?”, he said as he motioned to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 78</a><div class="page-content">large carriage parked at the far end of the loading zone. “We’ll load your cart now”.

“Thanks”.

He walked back out from under the awning as the factory workers pushed doublechests on to the loading dock, where small droplets</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 78</a><div class="page-content">fell onto their coarse wood. He stopped to inspect his cart, momentarily tuning out the hubris of the yard. He knew there was a long journey ahead. This was no short hop from Augusta to Civcorp along that southern highway he knew so well. It had been a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 78</a><div class="page-content">long time since he had picked a load this far north in the map. The droplets falling over him seemed to grow stronger in intensity, and the water turned dirt to mud at his feet.

The door of his carriage slammed shut as he fell into his seat. Clutching the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 78</a><div class="page-content">reins of his dual horses, he pulled, stirring them from idle. The cabin creaked as he leaned out of the side window, watching as the workers closed up the back of his cart.

“All set, sooner rather than later please!”, the yardmaster shouted.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 78</a><div class="page-content">“We have another cart waiting to dock”. Luke pulled on the reins. The burdened cart rumbled down the lot, past the opened gate and onto the main thoroughfare beyond.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 78</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>The Open Road</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The cart trundled along the boulevard as streaks of rain fell onto the street ahead. The large avenue was clogged with all manners of horses, carts and carriages, moving slowly around each other. The tall cypress trees lining the road</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 78</a><div class="page-content">towered above them, planted long before this neighbourhood had become an industrial zone. Their leaves, once vibrant and green, meant to give pleasant shade to the streets of an upscale residential neighbourhood, seemed yellowed by the hanging soot of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 78</a><div class="page-content">charcoal-blasted chimneys and factories everywhere around them.

Luke was slowly picking up speed as he got further and further from the city’s core, passing road signs indicating the upcoming interchange with the North-South Highway.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 78</a><div class="page-content">The amount of structures lining the road diminished, more and more empty plots and untouched land passed him by, less and less traffic appeared on the road itself until finally he steered his cart onto the asphalt of the highway itself. He metered his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 78</a><div class="page-content">grasp on the reins and his horses pulled faster, their hooves kicking up water where it was flung backwards by the large, fast-turning wheels of the cart. The unending rain fell through the haze all around as he picked up speed and settled into his seat,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 78</a><div class="page-content">his eyes focusing through the mist on the northerly road ahead.

       ＊   ＊   ＊

A loud beeping noise filled the cabin, interrupting Luke’s reverie. He reached down to the Discord Box, rapidly pressing a series of buttons</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 78</a><div class="page-content">along its side. The alarm stopped.

It had been a couple of hours since he had left the southern valleys and night had now fallen on the plains and fields. The lanterns affixed to the front of his cart illuminated a small patch of road in front of him,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 78</a><div class="page-content">lighting up the falling rain in the night.

“Weather alert. Weather alert”. The automated voice of the Discord weather bot pierced through the droning of the large wheels passing over wet asphalt.

“Severe storm system originating from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 78</a><div class="page-content">Icy Easterns of Napistan is descending on the mid-shard area. Precipitation warning is now in effect”.

Luke turned down the volume as the message repeated. He cursed under his breath, his eyes still locked on the unending road ahead.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 78</a><div class="page-content">The air had become noticeably colder. He could tell that he was gaining altitude. The horses slowed as they chugged up the incline. Occasionally, a lone horseman or a carriage would appear, travelling in the opposite direction, their redstone lights</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 78</a><div class="page-content">shining bright until they passed him at speed and disappeared again into the night. Somewhere behind him, the streetlights of a small village nestled in the valley glimmered through the falling streaks.

The rain turned to sleet as the road</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 78</a><div class="page-content">twisted and curved into the range. The foothills of the Napistan Mountains stood boldly as blackened silhouettes against the milky clouds of the night sky, barely visible and impossibly large. As he continued his ascent, the sleet became snow, and the loud</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 78</a><div class="page-content">patter of rainfall was gradually replaced by the quieter sounds of the wheels carving their way over fresh ice. The road and the forest around him was quickly buried under the snow and the unrelenting flurries clouded his narrow vision of the path ahead.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 78</a><div class="page-content">He was nearing the pass. The weather alert had repeated again, giving updated weather information, but the signal was abruptly lost as he curved around through. He hunched over and pushed the buttons, searching for a voice channel to connect to.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 78</a><div class="page-content">The cart swerved in the night, and when Luke glanced back at the road he immediately slammed on the brakes. The wheels locked up and slid to a stop as the horses neighed and complained. Slowly, he released the reins, squinting into the darkness. A dozen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 78</a><div class="page-content">blocks down the highway, the row of lanterns on his cart illuminated a disturbance, a dark spot on the white road. Something was moving on the road.

The corpse of a sheep- momentarily still, then stirring- lifted itself rigidly before collapsing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 78</a><div class="page-content">once more into a heap of fur and blood. Luke cracked the door of the carriage, and another sound could be heard through the howling of the wind: the gnashing and tearing of wet meat. He saw the glint of his carriage lights reflecting off powerful canine</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 78</a><div class="page-content">teeth as they sank themselves into the sinewy tendon of the dead animal.

Luke recognized it immediately, remembering the warning given to newfriends in their settlement pamphlets. They were told never to wander past the last row of torches at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 78</a><div class="page-content">night. It had been his eighth day, in the outskirts of a village now forgotten, when he saw a farmer shoulder a longbow and aim for a pair of eyes in the treeline.

His body was still as he reached his arm past the Discord Box and felt around underneath.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 78</a><div class="page-content">He always kept it stashed in a singlechest under the seat. One of his horses whinnied loudly, and the Big Dog looked up. Luke tucked the bow into his hotbar along with a stack of arrows. He clumsily loaded one into his weapon as the Big Dog began growling,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 78</a><div class="page-content">circling away from the corpse of the sheep and towards the cart.

Luke’s mind flashed back to the tamed wolves of CivCorp’s pet shop. He never imagined how much larger the wild ones were up close. Its snout was long, covered in rapidly darkening blood. Its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 78</a><div class="page-content">eyes were bloodshot with unexplainable fury and ceaseless rage. He remembered a post on the CivRealms forum. “Why do the Big Dogs kill?”. Its two large ears were folded back, its powerful body methodically picked its way closer and closer to the cart.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 78</a><div class="page-content">Luke dared not move. He wanted to raise the bow and open fire, but couldn’t bring himself to open the carriage door any further. His hands were clammy. He had never once used the bow on a living being. Could he aim true in the night? How fast could he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 78</a><div class="page-content">reload? He decided to set the weapon down onto the passenger seat and instead picked up the reins.

The wheels creaked and began to move, slipping for a second on the icy incline. the Big Dog stayed back as his cart passed around what remained of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 78</a><div class="page-content">carcass in the road. He was accelerating now with a blessed sigh of relief. He looked back, watching as the shadow of the canine figure faded back into obscurity. Two red eyes returned to the darkness from which they had emerged.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 78</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>The Grey</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Road closed for revinations”.

The sign blocking the highway was barely legible now, its corners accumulating snow and ice from the blizzard. “Revinations? Who put the newfriends on sign duty?” He had reached the pass</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 78</a><div class="page-content">just as the faintest hints of daybreak began to seep through the clouds, casting a ghastly glow onto the white valleys and forests around him. His feet touched the icy ground and began to ache after so many hours in the cart. Somewhere behind the thick</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 78</a><div class="page-content">overcast, the sun was rising once more.

He peered past the barricades and through the lessening snow. Around a hundred blocks ahead, the road indeed stopped, giving way to a largely impassable pit. He tucked his head back into the cabin and fumbled with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 78</a><div class="page-content">the Discord Box.

“Hello, can anyone hear me? Please advise alternate routes for Norvansgard. Is the pass closed?”

Apart from the Discord notification telling him his microphone was enabled, there was no</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 78</a><div class="page-content">response. He began cursing underneath his breath until he noticed a small dirt frontage road next to the wooden barricades. “Detour – 400 blocks South”, read the sign.

Luke gave a tug on the reins, gently convincing the burdened cart to turn</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 78</a><div class="page-content">back around. “400 blocks south”, he repeated to himself as his eyes scanned for the detour.

The blanketed light was permeating the land, slowly turning night to day. What had once been pitch black darkness revealed valleys interspersed with uneven fields.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 78</a><div class="page-content">A dense taiga forest, composed of pine and conifers, seemed to stretch out for thousands of blocks. Suddenly, he saw it. An opening to the side of the highway marked with an orange piece of wool fluttering in the wind.

The cart's wheels slipped off the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 78</a><div class="page-content">hard stone edge of the highway’s shoulder and onto the uneven snow-covered dirt. Luke was jostled about inside the cabin as the horses complained. Beneath the canopy of dead branches, progress was slow. The cart climbed above small rocks and twigs powdered</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 78</a><div class="page-content">with snow as he scanned the horizon for the detour route.The highway had already disappeared somewhere behind him.

A massive jolt hit the cart as the right wheel jumped over an unseen rock. His horses neighed loudly as the cart creaked and complained.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 78</a><div class="page-content">He knew the cargo couldn’t take much more abuse - already one of the chests revealed a fissure, and he knew he’d have to expect a claim from the consignee in Norvansgard. As he drove forward, he felt the uneven pull of a crooked wheel.

Luke gritted his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 78</a><div class="page-content">teeth. It was too late now to try and turn around. There was no orange wool on the horizon, but just a couple dozen blocks ahead seemed to be a clearing. It looked to crest over the pass, and he could see that it must lead downhill, probably reconnecting</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 78</a><div class="page-content">with the highway. A bittersweet feeling of relief washed over him. Once he reached Norvansgard, He promised himself he was going to leave an expletive-filled Discord message in the Road Maintenance Group server.

The cart accelerated, its wooden wheels</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-51"><a href="#page-51" class="page-indicator">Page 51 of 78</a><div class="page-content">pushing against the dirt and snow. He was finally approaching the clearing, approaching freedom, and approaching the promise of continuing his delivery unmolested. He pulled back on the reins, over the last bump of clustered branches and onto an unseen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-52"><a href="#page-52" class="page-indicator">Page 52 of 78</a><div class="page-content">drop into a snow-covered field.

He flinched, bracing himself as the cart momentarily went airborne. His horses were the first to make contact with the snow, their hooves sending flakes of snow flying all around. The cart smashed downwards moments later,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-53"><a href="#page-53" class="page-indicator">Page 53 of 78</a><div class="page-content">and there was an explosion of wooden splinters and panelling. It tilted to the side as Luke came to an abrupt stop. One of the doublechests slid forward and broke open, spilling compacted dark spruce into the cabin.

Stillness returned as the whinnying of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-54"><a href="#page-54" class="page-indicator">Page 54 of 78</a><div class="page-content">the horses subsided. Luke remained quiet for a minute, catching his breath. He swore once, and then a second time, pushing away compacted stacks of dark spruce. He managed to kick the door open and pulled himself out of the ruined cart.

His feet touched</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-55"><a href="#page-55" class="page-indicator">Page 55 of 78</a><div class="page-content">the virgin snow of the field and he steadied himself uneasily, assessing the situation. In an attempt to escape the forest, he had left the detour and driven right off the edge of an uneven slope. The highway was nowhere to be seen. A few snowflakes flew</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-56"><a href="#page-56" class="page-indicator">Page 56 of 78</a><div class="page-content">into his eyes and the cold of the mountain air bit his skin as he staggered around his sunken cart.

He guessed that he had probably made it over the pass and was on the other side of the range. He scanned the scenery for landmarks, but his squinting eyes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-57"><a href="#page-57" class="page-indicator">Page 57 of 78</a><div class="page-content">saw only snow-capped coniferous trees dotting the slopes of endless mountain sides and valleys. Had he gone off the eastern side of the pass? As many times as he had ridden this highway, this wilderness was foreign to him.

He crawled back into</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-58"><a href="#page-58" class="page-indicator">Page 58 of 78</a><div class="page-content">the cabin, pushing aside compacted wood and pieces of broken panelling. He reached down, finding the Discord Box still on, and began frantically pressing its buttons. He heard the notification of an activated microphone and grabbed the mic.

"Mayday,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-59"><a href="#page-59" class="page-indicator">Page 59 of 78</a><div class="page-content">mayday”. He caught his breath for a second before continuing. “My cart is stuck in a field next to the pass. I need someone to tie a lead to my horses and pull me out”.

He released his push-to-talk key and listened, but heard only the gentle</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-60"><a href="#page-60" class="page-indicator">Page 60 of 78</a><div class="page-content">gusting of cold wind.

“Hello, is anyone in range?”, he asked again. “My coords are… my coords…” His voice trailed off as he noticed the built-in radar in his cart had gone dark. "Fuck!" he yelled while throwing the mic back underneath the seat.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-61"><a href="#page-61" class="page-indicator">Page 61 of 78</a><div class="page-content">The wind changed and grew quiet. The light falling snow swirled in place for a moment, the meadow unnaturally silent. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed what might have been movement near the treeline.

Any worries he had about his cart were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-62"><a href="#page-62" class="page-indicator">Page 62 of 78</a><div class="page-content">suddenly pushed to the back of his mind. He felt a cold chill run through his body as he hurriedly rummaged through the loose items in the cabin and found his bow. A small Power II, Napistan-made. He had bought it from the black market in CivCorp when the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-63"><a href="#page-63" class="page-indicator">Page 63 of 78</a><div class="page-content">civil war in Miletos broke out and security had deteriorated along the coastal highway. He had never used it, save to practise shooting arrows into the lake behind his house.

He counted six arrows, of which two had spilled and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-64"><a href="#page-64" class="page-indicator">Page 64 of 78</a><div class="page-content">broken during the accident. Luke re-emerged from the cabin, a quiver slung across his back, clutching the bow in his right hand. He crouched, scanning the grey expanse around him. He made his way to the back of his cart, aiming to climb on its roof and get</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-65"><a href="#page-65" class="page-indicator">Page 65 of 78</a><div class="page-content">a better view of his surroundings. As he rounded the rear wheels, his heart froze.

Emerging from the forest one at a time, their glowing red eyes scanned the field in which he stood. Through the whispers of errant snowflakes he could see them</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-66"><a href="#page-66" class="page-indicator">Page 66 of 78</a><div class="page-content">picking their way closer and closer. The beasts growled menacingly, suddenly darting from the trees, flanking him and surrounding the sunken cart.

They continued circling. Luke grabbed an arrow from his quiver and brought it to the bow, loading it with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-68"><a href="#page-68" class="page-indicator">Page 68 of 78</a><div class="page-content">shaking hands. He racked the string with a click, causing the closest hound to stop, saliva dripping from its open mouth. For a moment it was mercifully still, but soon snarled and resumed its approach. The others followed suit.

Luke raised the bow</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-69"><a href="#page-69" class="page-indicator">Page 69 of 78</a><div class="page-content">and shouldered it, aiming down his sights. Through the finger-numbing cold and his racing heart, he couldn’t steady the damned thing. The beast picked up speed, now lunging forward and gnashing, its red eyes almost a mere ten blocks away.

He pulled the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-70"><a href="#page-70" class="page-indicator">Page 70 of 78</a><div class="page-content">trigger and the recoil jolted him back. The Big Dog let out a strained whimper, its body jerking rigidly as blood began pouring from its neck. It staggered for a moment, gurgling, and fell onto the ground in front of him. Hot arterial blood spurted from</div></div>

The beasts snarled and attacked from all directions. Luke let out a great yell, swinging his bow wildly onto the nearest gnashing snout. He saw the frenzied hound jump back for a moment, giving him a chance to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-72"><a href="#page-72" class="page-indicator">Page 72 of 78</a><div class="page-content">rush around the cart and reach back into the cabin. Using his freshly torn hand, he grabbed the latch of one of the crates and ripped it off, decompacting it.

The wood exploded violently and filled the cabin completely. Bits of dark spruce chips and bark</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-73"><a href="#page-73" class="page-indicator">Page 73 of 78</a><div class="page-content">flung out at high speed, shattering the panelling and scaring the Big Dogs back as it splintered in their faces. Luke grabbed a broken beam with a jagged tip before staggering as fast as he could through the snow towards the edge of the treeline.

In close pursuit, he could hear the leaping and bounding of their paws. They were closing in, but he only needed another couple of seconds before he’d reach the relative safety of the trees. He</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-75"><a href="#page-75" class="page-indicator">Page 75 of 78</a><div class="page-content">broke into the forest right as one of the beasts caught up to him.

He tumbled and turned, coming face to face with its frenzied jaw and glinting teeth. With all his might, Luke pushed back against the wild hound and hammered his bloody fist onto its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-76"><a href="#page-76" class="page-indicator">Page 76 of 78</a><div class="page-content">snout. Gnashing, blood-crazed, it locked its jaw onto his already wounded hand and mauled him.

“Agh! You fucking mutt!”, he shouted, jabbing the Big Dog with the wooden beam. In that moment, stumbling on the root of a tree, he lost his footing. Beast and</div></div>
