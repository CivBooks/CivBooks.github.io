           The
  Augustan Struggle
          

===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The readiness to sacrifice one's personal work and, if necessary, even one's life for
others shows its most highly developed form in the Augstan race.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The greatness of the
Augustan is not based on their intellectual powers, but rather on their willingness to devote all
their faculties to the service of Mount Augusta.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Here the instinct for self-preservation has
reached its noblest form; for the Augustan willingly subordinates their own ego to the
common weal and when necessity calls their will even sacrifice their own life for Mount Augusta</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The constructive powers of the Augustan and that peculiar ability they have for the building
up of a culture are not grounded in their intellectual gifts alone. If that were so they might
only be destructive and could never have the ability to organize</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 55</a><div class="page-content">for the latter
essentially depends on the readiness of the individual to renounce their own personal
opinions and interests and to lay both at the service of the player group.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 55</a><div class="page-content">By serving the
common weal they receive reward in return. For example, they do not work directly
for themself but makes productive work a part of the activity of the group to which
they belong, not only for their own benefit but for the general</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 55</a><div class="page-content">which to them does not at all signify a means
of earning one's daily livelihood but rather a productive activity which cannot clash
with the interests of Mount Augusta</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Whenever player activity is directed exclusively to
the service of the instinct for self-preservation it is called theft or usury, robbery or
burglary.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 55</a><div class="page-content">This mental attitude, which forces self-interest to recede into the background in favour
of the common weal, is the first prerequisite for any kind of player civilization. It
is out of this spirit alone that great player achievements have sprung</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 55</a><div class="page-content">for which the
original doers have scarcely ever received any recompense but which turns out to be the
source of abundant benefit for their descendants.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 55</a><div class="page-content">It is this spirit alone which can explain
why it so often happens that players can endure a harsh but honest existence which
offers them no returns for their toil except a poor and modest livelihood.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 55</a><div class="page-content">But such a
livelihood helps to consolidate the foundations on which the community exists.
Every Augustan who works without ever
achieving fortune or prosperity for themself, is a representative of this sublime idea</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 55</a><div class="page-content">even
though they may never become conscious of the profound meaning of their own activity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Everything that may be said of that kind of work which is the fundamental condition of
providing food and the basic means of player progress is true even in a higher sense of
work that is done for the protection of our civilization.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The renunciation of
one's own life for the sake of the community is the crowning significance of the idea of
all sacrifice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 55</a><div class="page-content">In this way only is it possible to protect what has been built up by Augustans and
to assure that this will not be destroyed by the hand of.....
 
The foreign Civva</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The Civvas offers the most striking contrast to the Augustan. There is probably no other
players in the world who have so developed the instinct of self-preservation</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The intellectual faculties of the Civva have been trained through over 10 years. Today the Civva is looked upon as specially 'cunning'; and in a certain sense they have been so
throughout the ages.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Their intellectual powers, however, are not the result of an inner
evolution but rather have been shaped by the object-lessons which the Civva has received
from others.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 55</a><div class="page-content">the Civva completely lack the most essential pre-requisite of a cultural
p;ayer, namely the idealistic spirit. With the Civva, readiness for sacrifice
does not extend beyond the simple instinct of individual preservation</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 55</a><div class="page-content">In their case the
feeling of solidarity which they apparently manifest is nothing but a very
primitive gregarious instinct.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 55</a><div class="page-content">this herd instinct brings individuals
together for mutual protection only as long as there is a common danger which makes
mutual assistance expedient or inevitable.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The same pack of wolves which a moment
ago joined together in a common attack on their victim will dissolve into individual
wolves as soon as their hunger has been satisfied.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 55</a><div class="page-content">This is also sure of horses, which
unite to defend themselves against any aggressor but separate the moment the danger
is over.
It is much the same with the Civva.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Where these
motives no longer exist then the most brutal egotism appears and these Civvas who
before had lived together in unity will turn into a swarm of rats that bitterly fight against each other.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 55</a><div class="page-content">If the Civvas were the only players in the world they would be wallowing in filth and mire
and would exploit one another and try to exterminate one another in a bitter struggle</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 55</a><div class="page-content">except in so far as their utter lack of the ideal of sacrifice, which shows itself in their
cowardly spirit, would prevent this struggle from developing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Therefore it would be a complete mistake to interpret the mutual help which the Civvas
render one another when they have to fight--or, to put it more accurately, to exploit their fellow player, as the expression of a certain idealistic spirit of sacrifice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 55</a><div class="page-content">To what extent the Civva appropriates the civilization built up by others--or rather
corrupts it, to speak more accurately -is indicated by the fact that Civvas cultivates chiefly
the art which calls for the smallest amount of original invention</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 55</a><div class="page-content"> And even here they are nothing better than a kind of juggler or, perhaps more correctly
speaking, a kind of monkey imitator; for in this domain also lacks the creative elan which is necessary for the production of all really great work</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Even here, therefore, they are
not a creative genius but rather a superficial imitator who, in spite of all their retouching
and tricks, cannot disguise the fact that there is no inner vitality in the shape Civvas gives
their products.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 55</a><div class="page-content">the Civvas have not the creative abilities which are necessary to the founding of a
civilization; for in them there is not, and never has been, that spirit of idealism which is an absolutely necessary element in the higher development of Mount Augusta</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Civva's intellect will never be constructive but always destructive.
It is not
through their help but in spite of their help that Augustans makes any progress.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 55</a><div class="page-content"> By permitting themselves to be entangled in the toils of the Civva, the MTA Government
prepared their own downfall. The position which they held among their people was
slowly but steadily undermined and eventually, taken.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Naturally the Civvas could now exploit the position to which he had attained and push
themself forward even more rapidly than before.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Finally they became elected and thus
entitled to all the rights and privileges which belonged to the players of the nation on
which they preyed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 55</a><div class="page-content">At this stage a transformation began to take place in the world of Civvary. Up to now
they had been Civvas--that is to say, they did not hitherto set any great value on
pretending to be something else;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 55</a><div class="page-content">nobody looked upon the Civvas as other than a 'foreign' players..
the Augustan recognized
that the Civva was the foreign body in their own flesh and their attitude towards them was
directed by recognition of that fact.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 55</a><div class="page-content">But a change was now destined to take place.
 In the course of more than ten 
years the Civva had learned to master the culture of their hosts so thoroughly that they
considered they might now lay stress on the Civva character and emphasize the
'Augustan' a bit more</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The Civva did not possess the slightest traces of the Augustan character. They had only
acquired the art of twisting the Augustan culture to their own uses, and that in a
disgusting way without having assimilated any other feature of the Augustan character.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Therefore the command of the culture was the sole ground on which he could pretend
to be a Augustan. It is not however by the tie of culture, but exclusively by the tie of
blood that the members of a player are bound together.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 55</a><div class="page-content">And the Civva themself knows this
better than any other, seeing that they attache so little importance to the preservation of
their own culture.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Attention may be called to the fact that, in spite of their proclaimed readiness to make
personal sacrifices, the Civva never becomes poor thereby. They have a happy knack of
always making both ends meet.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 55</a><div class="page-content">so typical of the Civva, they trumpeted their
virtues before the world until finally the world actually began to believe them. Those
who refused to share this belief were considered to be doing them an injustice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Thus after
a little while they began to twist things around, so as to make it appear that it was them who
had always been wronged, and vice versa.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 55</a><div class="page-content">There were really some particularly foolish
players who could not help pitying this poor unfortunate creature of a Civva.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 55</a><div class="page-content">In order to strengthen their political position, they directed their efforts towards removing
the barrier of Civva discrimination which had hitherto hindered their advance at
every turn.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Government circles, as well as the higher sections of the political and commercial
bourgeoisie, fell prey to the plans through Civva manipulation, though they themselves did not even suspect what was happening</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The most
important phase of policy was therefore to secure control over the Augustan. The Civva
realized that in their efforts to reach the position of public despot they would need a 'peacemaker.'</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-51"><a href="#page-51" class="page-indicator">Page 51 of 55</a><div class="page-content">As a sign of their growing presumption and sense of security, a certain section of them
openly and impudently proclaim their Civva nationality while another section
hypocritically pretend that they are Augustan,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-52"><a href="#page-52" class="page-indicator">Page 52 of 55</a><div class="page-content">Their blatant behaviour in their relations with other players shows how clearly they
envisage their day of triumph in the near future.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-53"><a href="#page-53" class="page-indicator">Page 53 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The black-hearted Civva youth lies in wait for hours on end, satanically glaring at and
spying on the unsuspicious Augustan whom then plans to seduce, adulterating the blood and
removing them from the bosom of their own people.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-54"><a href="#page-54" class="page-indicator">Page 54 of 55</a><div class="page-content">The Civva uses every possible means to
undermine the foundations of a subjugated players. In systematic efforts to
ruin Mt Augusta, they strives to break down the last barriers of discrimination
between them and other players.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-55"><a href="#page-55" class="page-indicator">Page 55 of 55</a><div class="page-content">We must secure the existence of our nation and a future for Augustan players
Because the beauty of the Augustan must not perish from the Earth</div></div>
