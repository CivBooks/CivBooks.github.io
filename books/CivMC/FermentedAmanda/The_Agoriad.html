The city of Old Agora, the ancestral home of the Agoran Federation, began as a hamlet of Anarcho-Capitalists founded soon after</div></div>

At some point soon after its founding, Old Agora was added to the global Civcraft maps, and was then abandoned. 
Old Agora lay</div></div>

Pantostado1066 was a relatively new Civcraft player, one with some strange beliefs and a big dream that would form the basis of what would become one of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 46</a><div class="page-content">the biggest cities in Civcraft. He believed in squatting, in other words occupying abandoned structures. This idea was and still is as of the time of writing somewhat novel in the world of Civcraft.
The influence of the AnCaps can still be seen in all of Civcraft's structures.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 46</a><div class="page-content">AnCaps believed in eternal property rights, and thus did
not believe in squatting. 
However, Old Agora had been abandoned for so long that the AnCaps who had founded it had either forgotten about it or left the server. Thus, there was no problem when Pantostado1066</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 46</a><div class="page-content">into the ruins of the city with some IRL
friends and began to rebuild, redevelop, and revive the city.
A central point of this revival was Pantostado1066's dream, which attracted several of the citizens that began to move to Old Agora, including myself.
That dream was to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 46</a><div class="page-content">build a University in 
Civcraft, a place of learning where the knowledge of the server could be brought to be shared freely. I had spawned in the abandoned city of Mercer, and joined the history department of the
Agora State University as well as constructing a museum</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 46</a><div class="page-content">showcasing what I had found on my journeys.
As the University grew, so did the city itself. It was during this era that such notable names as NukeJay joined what would become the Federation. However, this golden age was not to last.</div></div>

Following the increase of the population of Old Agora during the Foundational Era, Pantostado1066 decided that it was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 46</a><div class="page-content">time to create an Agoran government.
As such, he organized a basic government under the name of the
Agoran Republic. 
It was composed of several officials, such as the Mayor and the Dean of the University, who then voted on decisions for the Republic after being elected to their</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 46</a><div class="page-content">positions by the population. Pantostado1066 was easily elected as the first Mayor of the Republic, DonVlinar as the first Senator, alpav as the first Tribune, galvan_ as the first Consul, and myself as the first Dean of the University.
The new government</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 46</a><div class="page-content">quickly established itself, preparing for the establishment of
an official police force and authorizing the creation of a market inside the still incomplete Agora Tower.
The city grew still further as people expanded the public farms and worked to increase and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 46</a><div class="page-content">establish themselves.
However, as all Civcrafters sadly know, some people just want to watch the world burn. 
Al Kaowni was a group of people like that. Roleplaying Muslim terrorists, they rolled through Old Agora placing diamond reinforced obsidian everywhere and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 46</a><div class="page-content">destroying the still largely unreinforced city. Their reason? The Agora State University had no Muslim studies class.
All attempts to fix the damage and rebuild Old Agora were met with destruction by Al Kaowni, which continued to harass the city.
Because of this, the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 46</a><div class="page-content">government decided that Old Agora was no longer a viable settlement location and scouts were sent out to find a new location for the population of Old Agora to escape to. 
It was not long before one such location was found, and the Agoran Exodus began.</div></div>

Cressemopolis was another nearby AnCap settlement that had been abandoned early in Civcraft 1.0.
Situated just over 1000 blocks from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 46</a><div class="page-content">site of Old Agora, with a convenient already-flattened plain and nether road connection, and with only a few ruins, Cressemopolis appeared to be the perfect site to set up shop.
After the announcement was made that Agora would be moving to this site,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 46</a><div class="page-content">the populace of Old Agora quickly packed up and moved to the site, building dwellings along the extant pathways that had been left by the Cressemopolisians on the Plain.
Mayor Pantostado1066 quickly brought order to this chaos, and within a day roads were expanding and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 46</a><div class="page-content">plots were being established.
New Agora quickly grew larger than Old Agora, absorbing several nearby hermits into her growing fold.
Despite this growth, however, the Agoran Republic carefully maintained the secrecy of its existence and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 46</a><div class="page-content">location, hoping to avoid more massive griefings like the ones that had driven the Agorans out of Old Agora.
This trend of steady growth in both size and prosperity continued for several months, at which point it was decided that New Agora was advanced enough to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 46</a><div class="page-content">become public.
Around this time, the Agoran Republic had also gained stewardship over a small town started by Pantostado1066 called San Mateo. 
These two events marked the transition of the Agoran Republic into the next phase of its existence:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 46</a><div class="page-content">The Agoran Federation.</div></div>

The establishment of the Agoran Federation was an important transition in the history of Agora.
Generally, it marked the creation of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 46</a><div class="page-content">pre-Breakup Agoran state as well as the establishment of the culture that would drive the growth of New Agora, and later Aurora, and ultimately lead to the Breakup.
With the reorganization of the government into a federal structure, the Mayor was renamed Chancellor, and later</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 46</a><div class="page-content">on the other positions were renamed to various “Secretary” titles. 
Furthermore, the now-public nature of New Agora led to a huge population boom, giving rise to several new districts of New Agora, each with their own distinct culture within the greater Agoran culture.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 46</a><div class="page-content">The Docks were known for their lax building codes and general slumminess, the Swamps were known for their medieval-style structures, the Hills were known for claiming to be rich, and having lots of mansions.
The older portion of the city was organized</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 46</a><div class="page-content">into the Old Tribunal District, and was known for historic buildings as well as generally being the center of town. 
The Farms district, as it sounds, was known for having the public farms that fed the Agoran populace and drove the Agoran industry.
As time went on,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 46</a><div class="page-content">however, the Farms also became the site of major Agoran industry. 
A redstone specialist by the name of Captain_Neckbeard had moved to New Agora, and he brought with him several brilliant ideas that would jumpstart Agoran industry.
Firstly, he built an</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 46</a><div class="page-content">iron golem grinder which quickly flooded the iron and rose market throughout the city and allowed for the massive export of iron to less lucky cities. 
Following this marvel of engineering, he built a wood grinder which utilized saplings, bonemeals, pistons, and a belt of gravel</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 46</a><div class="page-content">and sand to automatically push trees onto a “gathering plain” which could hold huge amounts of logs and drastically reduced the time and effort involved in logging. 
The New Agora State University, the successor to the destroyed Agora State University, also</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 46</a><div class="page-content">became active during this time and experienced a boom in both construction and public awareness. 
Technically in existence since the founding of New Agora, the University had languished under several Deans, and later Secretaries of Education, who had not really done much</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 46</a><div class="page-content">besides clear a bit more of the ruins. 
With the election of Pantostado1066 and later orikebise, however, the University quickly became quite active, and the University Library became one of the largest repositories of knowledge in Civcraft.
Generally, this period</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 46</a><div class="page-content">in Agoran history was characterized by massive growth economically, socially, and in terms of population.
All of this was accomplished despite the HCF War due to Agora’s policy of Neutrality at all Costs, which caused the HCF to largely ignore the city despite its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 46</a><div class="page-content">burgeoning population. Several terror attacks were perpetrated by the Al Kaowni, however New Agora’s newfound strength allowed for these attacks to be quickly cleaned up.
This golden age of New Agora would survive political scandals and other attacks, lasting until</div></div>

It was he that led the core players of New Agora, as well as some others that tagged along, to the new home of the Federation: what is today known as Aurora.
Placed near the coordinates of New Agora in 1.0, Aurora quickly swelled with newfriends through</div></div>

This population surge brought about the rise of several new figures in Agoran politics and history, Ogel6000 and taargus_.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 46</a><div class="page-content">However, “Agora” was quickly changing. 
The influx of newfriends, who had not absorbed the culture of 1.0 Agora, quickly overwhelmed the Agorans from 1.0, leading to a gradual cultural shift towards the newfriend culture and the creation of two distinct cultural groups within the city.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 46</a><div class="page-content">The Oldgorans consisted of the Agorans from 1.0 and a few people that they had assimilated into their cultural group, while the Newfriends (alternatively known as the newf<span class="fmtk"><span class="fmtcode">§k</span>a</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>gs) consisted of the new populous. 
These two different cultures began to clash due to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 46</a><div class="page-content">differences in how they believed that the government should work.
