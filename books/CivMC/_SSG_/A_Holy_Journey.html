<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 14</a><div class="page-content"> This a testament of a
pig-lamb, the grand sacrifice of the pink sheep, the death of a child of a god.
 
 There was once a Tree, THE TREE, a spruce tree to be exact. That tree was a holy tree and that tree had a just as so pious brother. That brother was Roinkelle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Roinkelle was a benevolent diety and would be a sheep, an incredible red sheep. Roinkelle, though pious, was too quite adulterous & would bed a mortal sheep, a normal sheep, a white sheep, she was named Ba'athricia. The sheep Ba'athricia would, though allegedly normal was devious.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">She too was adulterous as her lover, Roinkelle, she was very criminal, Ba'athricia was above all scheming. Ba'athricia, wouldn't attempt to bare fruit with Roinkelle due to her adulterous core but her scheming, she would taint the glory of the god Roinkelle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content"> Ba'athricia would taint Roinkelle's glory just as she would taint the colour of Roinkelle's fur when she would birth a pink coloured sheep, this sheep like the child of all mixings of evil & glory would be a husk, a husk Ba'athricia would manipulate.
 When the pink sheep was but a lamb she</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">would blessed by her father, and soon after Ba'athricia would use this grand blessing to sway man and animal alike away from the Great Red Sheep by telling them that her tainted offspring was somehow more powerful that even it's father, the young pink sheep, a mere child,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">would go along with these lies. But when this happened Roinkelle would be deeply displeased at his daughter & equally angered at his lover.
 Many years later Ba'athricia would grow old and her lover, eternal, would stay the same in mind and body. At this time Roinkelle would speak,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Roinkelle would reveal his power to animal and man alike, he would bless the entirety of Nara and their streets would remain paved in gold for all time. But just as he blessed these lands he would damn the lands of his lover's and of his daughter's birth to be flooded eternally, in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">the process this would flood all lands at or below the level of it to become the seas.
 Centuries later Roinkelle's daughter would reveal herself to her father as the pink one would cut down all trees in the far eastern lands, red lands previously populated by spruce</div></div>

Roinkelle would then strip this pink sheep of her godly powers, all except immortality, forced to roam the land forever, Roinkelle would begin to pity his daughter who was lead astray by evil.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content"> Even more centuries later Roinkelle would ordain me, the writer of this text, SSG, to find his daughter and take her out of her misery. This would be no easy task though as I would originate and live in the blessed land, Winterbourne, far from the location of Roinkelle's own. Thankfully, I was given</div></div>

I would then heed the word of the god directing me and Roinkelle would lead me to his daughter. I know now but not knowing then, would be</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">continent. I would do this and be told to keep the remaining meat and all wool not stain red as well as the 7 bottles as holy relics not to be touched by any that Roinkelle himself does not deem worthy.
 There, just like this, are many other stories of Roinkelle's glory, but this is</div></div>
