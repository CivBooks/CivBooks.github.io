 It has been many days since I went on my adventure and pilgramage to kill the pink sheep. I was walking near the greater of the 2 vaults near my home</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 7</a><div class="page-content">in Winterbourne. I very suddenly heard a voice however. It was from a tree, but this was not the tree of legend as it was an oak tree speaking to me. Unfortunately this tree would not speak the word of good but of malice, this would heavily and deeply disturb me, this evil devious tree would</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 7</a><div class="page-content">tell me to turn my back on my gods, all gods of good and charitable character, and turn to The Oak Tree, "Turn to me, turn to my side, my valor, do this and you will be rewarded with 3 million diamonds and the love and respect of your peers," the terrible tree would say to me. I decided,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 7</a><div class="page-content">I would not betray my gods. Quickly, I would vigorously run south towards a nearby thinning spruce forest, the first tree I found there I would pray to, I would bow down and pray to the tree and in the distance I would hear the most immense of noises, as though all evils had been sent</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 7</a><div class="page-content">into the heavens and all goods have decended to save me from the great evil of The Oak Tree. I would quickly turn around to observe what happened and it would happen again and again, and again, and again, it was lightning, with no storm and clear skies.
 I would stand there</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 7</a><div class="page-content">in shock and awe, but then I heard a whisper, a calm voice, meek and kind, would suggest I go towards site of the evil. I, without question to the place I found The Oak Tree, it was no longer there, at it's base was a solid block of gold, and the Oak was gone.
 A ray of light would fall upon me in this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 7</a><div class="page-content">time, coming from the stars. I would be told by the very same voice to write of this. I would of course, as I am now after waiting at the railway for a small while.
