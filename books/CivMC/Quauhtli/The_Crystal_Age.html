<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 41</a><div class="page-content">They traveled along the river until they came upon a clearing of plains between the jungle and two mountains.

<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 41</a><div class="page-content">And since Yoahtl had not been on a factions server before, Yoahtl was unfamiliar with the style of play on the server and unfortunately neglected to learn more about it. Inevitably, they were attacked by men with enchanted weapons and armor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 41</a><div class="page-content">The raiders laid waste to Yoahtl as Yoahtl had very few enchanted items of their own. It would have been the end of the city had a few mods not come to their assistance. The mods flew through the sky raining arrows upon the raiders and succeeded in driving them away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 41</a><div class="page-content">The mods then bid the Yoahtlan farewell and continued about their business.

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 41</a><div class="page-content">Just like when they first joined the server, the Yoahtlan journeyed for several hours onto the direction of the rising sun.

After traveling across large tracts of land and several oceans, the Yoahtlan came upon an island</div></div>

with a jungle/plains area at the foot of a very large forested mountain on the banks of a small sea. Here, they founded a new city and named it Tlaloc after the Aztec god of water and rain.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 41</a><div class="page-content">Halbyrd had also grown causing the population of Yoahtl to grow much larger and quicker than it ever had before and due to this new influx of people, the Yoahtlan culture and it’s ideals began to flourish among it’s people.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 41</a><div class="page-content">These people also contributed to the Yoahtlan style of architecture and after some time the style improved and became more unique to Yoahtl. Then, for the first time since the days of Xephos, Yoahtl had more than one settlement.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 41</a><div class="page-content">Civilization started spreading all across their remote island to the desert in the east and the plains to the south. The city in the desert was named Aztlan and Tikal was in the plains. Yoahtl also used this time to adopt and use the factions plugins of the server itself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 41</a><div class="page-content">With this renaissance of the Yoahtlan practices, the Yoahtlan had stepped out of their nomadic ways. Yoahtl became much more “Civilized”.

Yoahtl soon had a member count of around 30-40 at this time and soon became the top faction on Halbyrd.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 41</a><div class="page-content">

While Halbyrd was larger than it was before, it was still smaller than most other servers. This prompted the first warriors to be trained in Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 41</a><div class="page-content">These warriors were aided by the fact that Yoahtl could now mass produce enchanted diamond weapons and armor.

This was the first time Yoahtl had ever encountered such a large amount of bronies,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 41</a><div class="page-content">or bronies in general. Several Yoahtlan were very uncomfortable due to the massive pixel art next to Tlaloc and how close the faction was on a whole.

The Negotiations would turn sour.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 41</a><div class="page-content">This angered Yoahtl as a whole, especially Quauhtli. Yoahtl asked them to leave the island but they refused. This caused Yoahtl to declare war on Mylttlpny.

Yoahtl used this power to claim more of the pixel art and set it aflame. On the fourth day Mylttlpny mounted an assault with about seven people at a moment when Yoahtl only had five citizens available to defend.</div></div>

Soon they were burning the remainder of the pixel art. After that, the faction owner of Mylttlpny disbanded the faction. It was a clear and decisive victory.</div></div>
