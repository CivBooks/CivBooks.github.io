<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">After Xephos, Wichita would find a server for him and Yoahtl to use.

Wichita was a gentle soul and never cared much for expansion or how many members there were. All he cared about was giving meaning to Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content"> In the Xephos times, Wichita was known as a spiritualist and he continued his way of playing into the new servers .As Wichita is responsible for Yoahtl's reputation as a spiritual community for much of it's time. Wichita loved all things spiritual and 'new agey' and had an air of wisdom about him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content"> Some thought of him as much older than the rest due to this perception. As he'd been there for those who were down and always gave advice for those who needed it and in the future Wichita would come to be known as the Shaman Chieftain of Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Wichita would lead his small group of Yoahtlan across these small servers, changing as each server died. But after each passing server, Yoahtl grew smaller and smaller.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">These were the nomadic times of Yoahtl and throughout their travels, Wichita imbued his spiritualism upon the people and being of Yoahtl.

Wichita believed that Spiritualism and Science were the same in many aspects.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">To claim that both concepts were made for the same reason; to find truth and unlock its secrets to better mankind. 

It was from there Yoahtl became more into finding truth from within themselves whilst taking inspiration from their surroundings.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">It was at this time the first Seminars would be held. Named after the Seminars and Seminaries given in Catholicism, these were made for debate and discussion between Yoahtlan.

At this time no outside communication was used in Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Yoahtl also became known for its affinity for universal acceptance. Anyone was accepted no matter belief or identity. Wichita's reign as Yoahtl's second chieftain was overall one of enlightenment and cultural growth rather than political growth or expansion.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">In a way, Wichita had achieved his goal. He had managed to give Yoahtl meaning, at least in theory. Although intellectually sound, Yoahtl was still very small. And despite the sense of community, people would still leave Yoahtl to seek higher things.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">In a way, Wichita had achieved his goal. He had managed to give Yoahtl meaning, at least in theory. Although intellectually sound, Yoahtl was still very small. Though, despite the sense of high community, people would still leave to seek higher things.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">After a while, he stumbled upon a small server that Quauhtli was playing in. Quauhtli was very new to Minecraft and playing under the name “yyyyaaa”. Wichita invited him into Yoahtl and he joined earnestly. Quauhtli was happy to play with other people and his love for Yoahtl grew.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content"> As immature as Quauhtli was, Wichita took him under his wing and every day Wichita would share wisdom from Yoahtl and beyond. He taught Quauhtli the ways of the spiritual Yoahtlan.
Quauhtli would come to mature under the wing of Wichita.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">One day, Wichita told Quauhtli of Xephos and the nature of servers like those. He said that conflict would always come but in those places it comes quicker. He warned Quauhtli of those places and why he kept Yoahtl away from larger servers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Soon after, Wichita announced that he would be leaving for College, leaving Yoahtl in the care of Quauhtli as the third Chieftain.
Quauhtli continued as Wichita had before him; carrying Yoahtl from server to server as needed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Because of how important Wichita was to Quauhtli, Quauhtli vowed to keep Yoahtl alive for Wichita and to uphold the values he had instilled upon the community. Quauhtli and his band of seven other Yoahtlan traveled on to the next server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 17</a><div class="page-content">As the chieftainship shifted to Quauhtli, he envisions a far more involved and expanded Yoahtl.

And with new leadership; Yoahtl leaves the Shaman days as a nomadic people, and the first steps to a more solidified Yoahtl takes root.</div></div>
