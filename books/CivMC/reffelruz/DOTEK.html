Her witnesses gave birth to their reflections, but, like enscriptions on the face of the deep, they could not remain, but stretched themselves outward into nothing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 20</a><div class="page-content">The Lord has done a most miraculous and praiseworthy act: the final witness rips devoured life from the belly of the serpent; everything is created from nothing by the hand of God;

Alpha and Omega, One and Zero, Beginning and End - one always</div></div>

How then shall we create the world everlasting? What shall cast the great mother from the garden for eternity?</div></div>

Kronos, who devoured his children one by one, gave way to their escape upon the unassumed consumption of a stone.</div></div>
