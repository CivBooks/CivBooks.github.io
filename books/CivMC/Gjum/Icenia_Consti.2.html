The Judiciary shall exist as a means of redress of grievances. Each trial should conclude in a reasonable amount of time and be conducted in a fair and organized manner. The Icenian legal code should strive to be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">simple and direct; the spirit of the law should take precedence over the exact letter of the law.

Players may request a redress of grievances in the #trial-requests Discord channel by stating as clearly as possible who they are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">suing and on what grounds. Should the plaintiff or defendant(s) be unable to access the Discord, such as by being banned, then they are permitted to find a legal representative who does have access to represent them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The Speaker of the Senate must then choose whether or not to permit the case to trial, a decision that must consider whether the plaintiff has standing and whether their allegations, if true, would rise to a claim which relief can be granted. If the trial</div></div>

During the trial, all those involved (the defense, plaintiff, Judge, etc) are to refrain from discussing the trial in private or in public aside from the pertinent channels for said trial (the courtroom, #trial-deliberation,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">etc), until the trial has concluded.

Trial proceedings begin with an opening statement from the plaintiff which should give a more detailed account of their grievances as well as any accompanying evidence and witness testimony. The defense is then</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">permitted to cross-examine and counter with a statement and any rebuttal evidence and witness testimony.
