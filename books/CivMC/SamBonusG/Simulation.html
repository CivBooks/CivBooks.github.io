<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">After years of studying the night sky from the observatory floor of Lazuli Tower, I think I am finally prepared to present my theory of why we are here.

As I looked at the night sky of CivMC, I started noticing something rather peculiar. There were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">large areas of the night sky that seemed to be completely void. No stars, just darkness. I began to notice that these voids were taking on a hexagonal shape, and tessalating with other hexagonal voids. The stars were merely acting as the borders of these hexagons of darkness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">It started to become more apparent that the night sky that we all see regularly may actually be made by design. I ran through so many scenarios in my head, but the only one that makes sense is that the sky, and possibly everything we know to exist, is merely a simulation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Existence for civvas has always been perplexing. Some of us disappear from this world as quickly as we appear. Others have been here so long that we have lived through multiple apocalypses. While there are multiple religions claiming that there is an afterlife, nobody has presented</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">anything of proof. But if our world is a simulation, perhaps we are all actually avatars for some higher being. Perhaps some of us find purpose here in our avatar existence, and stick around longer. And those that do not, simply leave this realm and try a different avatar in a different</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">game, er, reality. And if this is the case, and our existence is merely an occasional escape for higher beings with much more complicated lives, then perhaps the lesson is to not take anything in the world of CivMC too seriously. One day, we will cease to exist in this world, and move on to much more</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">important things in a reality we as simulated civva avatars cannot comprehend.

At the end of the day, nothing in this world matters nearly as much as the things that matter to whoever is controlling us as avatars.</div></div>

Relax.

It's literally only minecraft.

Nothing actually matters.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.</div></div>
