Despite some talk of taking more part in world affairs, there was a consensus among the citizenry that Aurora should remain peaceful and neutral as ever.<span class="fmt0"></span>

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 44</a><div class="page-content">   But alas, it was not meant to be. Tjikko was home to many ambitious imperial powers, and foremost among them was Concordia.
