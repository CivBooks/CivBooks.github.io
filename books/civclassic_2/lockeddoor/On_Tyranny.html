<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">  "Tyranny" is a word almost as old as civilization itself, and the concept arguably predates it. Ever since the first flea-ridden, shit-smeared proto-human picked up a rock and smashed his cousin's brains in, man has sought to impose his will on others.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">  For that is all tyranny truly is: the imposition of one's will on another by force. From the fascist dictator slaughtering dissidents in the streets, to the cult leader warping young minds, to the fratboy forcing himself on a classmate, all impose their</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">will on others, all are tyrants.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  It is often said that to kill is to take a life. This is false. A murderer takes nothing; he has gained nothing. A murderer <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>destroys <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>a life, it is the tyrant who <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>takes<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> a life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">  For when a man is subjected to tyranny, not even the breath on his lips can be said to his own. His heart beats at the pleasure of his tyrant, and every action he undertakes is at another's whim. The tyrant denies his right to self and seeks to subsume</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">his body under their will.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  This, too, is the danger of tyranny, for a tyrant has not one body, but many. A tyrant is powerful. And in the absence of a greater power, tyranny will spread from person to person like a cancer on society until</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">only one free will remains: the will of the tyrant.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  If there is anything that history has proven, though, it's that tyranny is <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>not<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> inevitable, that it is <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>not<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> invincible, that the growth of this cancer <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>can<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> be stopped. But still,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">it is powerful. Tyranny can reign for millenia with scarcely a hint of freedom, yet a free world will be constantly rife with budding tyrants.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  So, in order to maintain their freedom, the citizens of a free world must be ever-vigilant against</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">the menace of tyranny, in all its forms.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  It is a common--and harmful--mistake to conflate "tyranny" and "dictatorship," or to conflate "freedom" and "democracy." It is true that dictatorships frequently result in tyranny, and that democracies</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">frequently resist it, but it is entirely possible for a dictator to use their power to defend the freedoms of their citizens better than a democracy ever could, and it is equally possible for a democracy to allow tyranny, often against a minority.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">  The solution, of course, is to combine the two systems. A democratic society will tend to resist tyranny, at least against the majority, but requires a centralized power, both to more efficiently organize a defense against external threats to freedom,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">and to reign in any individual citizens who attempt to engage in small-scale tyranny.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  This alone, though, isn't enough. A central power will generally tend to seek to increase their own power, until the point where, as in a dictatorship, there is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">no defense against tyranny by the state.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  So, the people must be vigilant not only against tyranny itself, but against government power, even if that power is used at first in defense of freedoms. A balance must be struck between the individual's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">freedoms, and the government's power to defend those freedoms. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>And that balance must be kept.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I do not posit to know with certainty what that proper balance is. But this I do know: complacency will lead to tyranny just as sure as light</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">casts a shadow. For tyranny is strong. It is insiduous. Unless it is constantly beaten back, it will spread like an infectious disease. But it <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>can<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> be beaten. Do not believe the tyrants who claim otherwise, for if you give them your complacency, you</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 16</a><div class="page-content">give them your freedom. It is the duty of every citizen to fight tyranny, in all its forms, until their dying breath. For that is the only way freedom can be preserved.</div></div>
