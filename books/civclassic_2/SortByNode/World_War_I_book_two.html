<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 43</a><div class="page-content">This news came off as especially jarring due to news that had been announced earlier: Wyck and the Federation had formed an alliance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Moria began to grow paranoid because of the widely-accepted view that Federation was made up of overly aggressive bullies.</div></div>

This came off to the Morians as a mustering of troops and a preparation to expand themselves further.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 43</a><div class="page-content">GetNGoing's concerns only grew when the announcement of the annexation of Brandenburg and Macrat7's enlistment.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Brandenburg was especially close to Moria and the other Omni-Alliance states.

<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 43</a><div class="page-content">These had been gathered due to large payments for a single weapon.

<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 43</a><div class="page-content">With all the growing tensions between the cold war participants, GetNGoing notified the leader of Omnitopia, LunisequiouS, alerting him to Vaal's situation.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Moria began mass- producing weapons, hiring people, gathering other nations to fight, and even creating a page where the Omni-Alliance could coordinate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Important to note was that the Omni-Alliance was keen on not starting any conflict, seeing as whomever was deemed "the bad guy" would lose neutral nations' support and create another obstacle overcome.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Throughout the cold war and actual conflict, the King of Moria, Bouer, was very much against any involvement in a war.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Everyone was in an absolute craze when they heard about Pearl Harbor.
