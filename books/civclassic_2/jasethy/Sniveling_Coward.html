<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     One cold autumn evening, as winter began to draw near, the good and gentle townsfolk of Rhodes began to make preparations for the cold weather that was sure to follow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"I'll store food," said one burly, warm-faced gentleman.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'll make sure our buildings are in good repair," said another. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Off to the side, a foul-faced, status-chasing coward sneered. Rolling his eyes, the coward</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Why is no one asking me anything?" the coward wondered. His mind began to turn in thought.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'll show them," he said. "I'm sure they'll</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     The next day, the coward work up bright and early to bring his plan into action. Walking through town, it seemed like he was the only one</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 30</a><div class="page-content">who was not hard at work. To an outsider, it would seem like he was as foreign as they were. While his fellow townsmen were strong, brave, and kind-hearted, his scheming, two-faced, social-climbing way of life stood out like a maggot in an apple.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Stopping in a field to the side of town, the coward had found his target.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Aha," he said. "He's collecting wheat but he isn't following the rules. He isn't supposed to harvest that way!"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He stood at the side.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"HEY!" the coward screamed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The strong farmer preparing for the winter looked up.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What is wrong, brother?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What a coward," he thought. "What a bumbling, sniveling coward."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The coward was furious that the farmer ignored him, so he made a note and continued on.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content">A few fields down, he found another mark. At the town cemetery, the coward saw a broad-shouldered farmer kneeling in front of a tombstone.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"HEY!! HEY YOU!!" the coward shrieked. His voice was pathetic and grating at the same time.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"Pardon?" said the farmer.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"You aren't WORKING!" whined the coward.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The farmer showed a flash of frustration in his face. The coward continued.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The farmer almost replied but decided to ignore the sniveling coward standing before him instead.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"HEY! Aren't you going to listen to me? HEY!"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was no use. The</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 30</a><div class="page-content">farmer wanted nothing to do with the coward.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The coward felt the blood rush into his face. In his head, he was a rising power in the town and deserving of respect. Yet, face-to-face with his peers, it seemed like they saw no authority in him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"I'll show them," said the coward. He began to sprint towards the town hall.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     "HEY! HEY! OPEN UP!" screamed the coward as he shook the town hall door with his small, sweaty fists. Inside, the big guys rolled their eyes. They knew what was coming.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"What is it?" they asked.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The coward was out of breath.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

And the ones that are harvesting food a-aren't ... aren't doing it right!"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Why did the coward find pleasure in being a pathetic little narc? What joy did he find</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Okay," said the big guys.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Okay?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Rules are rules," they continued. "Let's go find the rule breakers and sort this out."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content">The sniveling coward felt a pang of glee in his concave chest. "Finally," he thought. "I'll have the power I deserve."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The coward and the big guys arrived at the cemetery and collected the farmer praying at the grave. Then, they walked a</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Listen carefully," one of the big guys said sternly. The coward could barely wait to hear the trouble the farmers would get into.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"This coward here gets some sort of</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"And leave me alone while I harvest the food that will feed you this winter," the first farmer added.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The coward absorbed the shock of the twist the conversation took. "They're actually</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 30</a><div class="page-content">trying to punish ME?" he thought angrily. "Instead of THEM? When THEY broke the RULES?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The coward thought for a moment and looked at his peers.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I don't need you," he said. "I'll find a new place to live."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 30</a><div class="page-content">     A few days later, the coward passed into another town full of gentle-hearted, kind-faced people.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'm looking for a place to stay," said the coward.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Of course, brother, have some food." The welcome was warm.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Listen to me and listen carefully," he said.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
