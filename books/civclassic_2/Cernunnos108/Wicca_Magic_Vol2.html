It is a principal tool of witchcraft, and a phallic representation of the God. Like the athame,</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Candles are an almost universal witch's tool. They're used to absorb and then slowly release your personal energy and the intent of the spell. The color of the candle used for a spell is determined by the purpose of the spell</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 46</a><div class="page-content">but there is some disagreement among Wiccans about which colors work best for which spells.

<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Robes are the ritual garments worn during the casting of a spell.

<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Rituals vary in length and ceremony from witch to witch, but at the most basic, casting the circle involves lighting a candle, (usually white, for purification)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 46</a><div class="page-content">and then ritually invoking the four Quarters in turn, starting with the north or east and working clockwise.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 46</a><div class="page-content">After a spell or ritual is done, the circle is closed by reversing the casting ceremony: start by facing west and bid each Quarter thanks and farewell in a counterclockwise order, then snuff your candle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Ritual language such as a rhymed or metered chant is normally used, and the basic phrasing for each direction is the same, to create repetition.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Cast a simple blessing to attune your body and spirit.
