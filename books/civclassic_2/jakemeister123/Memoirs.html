<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 12</a><div class="page-content">After almost five and a half years playing, I feel my time here is coming to an end. Most of my friends have since moved on, few remain.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I seek appropriate closure to end my Civcraft career, and plan a trip to Hallow. I anticipate a noble death.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">So dear reader, if you exist, I am probably pearled. I hope I fought a good fight, but I suppose you can check on reddit as I plan on recording my inevitable demise. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I don't have much to say really, I shan't bother going into my Civcraft history.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Each person's Civcraft life is as varied and interesting as mine, that's what is beautiful about this server.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As I am writing this in Icenian house with a soon to be Kaiserin flag hanging above it, it is appropriate I mention that one of my first</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Civcraft interactions was NovaCeasar giving me and Treedssaa a good job and paying us very well, and I hated the way Icenia treated her. I don't hold grudges, but I like the flag :)<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I am sorry for the potential grief it will cause.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I will include some of my thoughts on Mir. Not that they are more deserving than any other city I have had the pleasure of being in, but I assume the reader will want to hear about them more than any other.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I was absolutely not surprised that upon my return after a brief hiatus that Mir was as much of a power as when I left. Lysika is probably the best leader of any city I have heard, and without him Mir would not have been half of what it is today.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I remember that plans without him felt completely empty and they were doomed to fail. When we were underdogs, when all odds were against us, he would motivate us to rise above, grind harder than anyone else and pull through.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But dont let this take away</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">from the rest of Mir. They're all absolutely work horses and so fun to be in a city with. This whole war is kind of silly honestly, but again, I could have predicted the result. Mir are amazing.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Sad to leave em, suppose.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Don't let this opinion of Mir take away anything away from how great Nexus/Vale was. For a long time, I talked to them more than my IRL friends. They're all amazing. Snorri in particular is a great guy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I think Mir will be pissed at me for getting pearled by Hallow, and Hallow will try and brag about pearling me. But I hope my death doesn't invoke toxic thoughts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Anyway, I suppose I should stop sucking people off. I will conclude with I loved Carbon, I loved Nexus/Vale, I loved America, I loved Forsaken, and I love Mir. I love all of you. Yes even you SkyHg and <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>DarkJesusMn...maybe<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>.</div></div>
