Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. this traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Before advancing my own arguments for laziness, I must</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 49</a><div class="page-content">dispose of one which I cannot accept. Whenever a person who already has enough to live on proposes to engage in some everyday kind of job, such as school-teaching or typing, he or she is told that such conduct takes the bread out of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 49</a><div class="page-content">other people's mouths, and is therefore wicked. If this argument were valid, it would only be necessary for us all to be idle in order that we should all have our mouths full of bread. What people who say such things forget is that what a man earns he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 49</a><div class="page-content">usually spends, and in spending he gives employment. As long as a man spends his income, he puts just as much bread into people's mouths in spending as he takes out of other people's mouths in earning. The real villain, from this point of view, is the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 49</a><div class="page-content">man who saves. If he merely puts his savings in a stocking, like the proverbial French peasant, it is obvious that they do not give employment. If he invests his savings, the matter is less obvious, and different cases arise.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One of the commonest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 49</a><div class="page-content">things to do with savings is to lend them to some Government. In view of the fact that the bulk of the public expenditure of most civilized Governments consists in payment for past wars or preparation for future wars, the man who lends his money to a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Government is in the same position as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of the man's economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to which he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 49</a><div class="page-content">money, even if he spent it in drink or gambling.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But, I shall be told, the case is quite different when savings are invested in industrial enterprises. When such enterprises succeed, and produce something useful, this may be conceded. In</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 49</a><div class="page-content">these days, however, no one will deny that most enterprises fail. That means that a large amount of human labor, which might have been devoted to producing something that could be enjoyed, was expended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 49</a><div class="page-content">and did no good to anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is therefore injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in giving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so would</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 49</a><div class="page-content">all those upon whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and the bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for surface card in some place where surface cars turn out not to be wanted, he has diverted a mass of labor</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 49</a><div class="page-content">into channels where it gives pleasure to no one. Nevertheless, when he becomes poor through failure of his investment he will be regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay spendthrift, who has spent his money</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 49</a><div class="page-content">philanthropically, will be despised as a fool and a frivolous person.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>All this is only preliminary. I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of work,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 49</a><div class="page-content">and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 49</a><div class="page-content">orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of advice are given simultaneously by two organized bodies of men; this is called politics. The skill required for this kind of work is not knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Throughout Europe, though not in America, there is a third class of men, more respected than either of the classes of workers. There are men who, through</div></div>

Modern technique has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It is obvious that, in primitive communities, peasants, left to themselves, would not have parted with the slender surplus upon which the warriors and priests subsisted, but would have either produced less or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 49</a><div class="page-content">consumed more. At first, sheer force compelled them to produce and part with the surplus. Gradually, however, it was found possible to induce many of them to accept an ethic according to which it was their duty to work hard, although part of their work</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 49</a><div class="page-content">went to support others in idleness. By this means the amount of compulsion required was lessened, and the expenses of government were diminished.

The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their masters rather than for their own. Of course</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 49</a><div class="page-content">the holders of power conceal this fact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical with the larger interests of humanity.
