As the Anarcho-Capitalist towns of Cresemopolis, N5K2, and Rift grow and prosper, it is easy to forget that we are not the only burgeoning civilizations in this world.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Of these groups, I had only been able to attain the co-ordinates of one major settlement: the minarchist city-state</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I began to search arround the ancap cities for anyone who had visitied Columbia. I asked high and low, but the most I was given were snippets of hearsay. It became increasingly apparent that the only way I was going to find out more</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> towards funding a trip through the Nether to Columbia. Despite my reckless spending however, I was still woefully unprepared for the task at hand. Which is why I</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  After some discussion, Toshibi and AI both requested to join me on my journey. With their combined resources and our</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">collective brainpower, we refined our plans . And so, the expedition was born.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  And shortly after this we headed off into the Nether. AIbatross proved an able navigator, taking point as we left the safety of the hub passageways and  found ourselves in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">the grim and open bowels of the Nether.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  In the beginning the going was relatively easy. we followed the paths of various abandoned Nether roads, providing for us at least a little safety from the many fires which consumed the landscape. But eventually</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">these roads ran out, and we made our way into uncharted and barren lands. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  It was not long before we found ourselves under fire from Ghasts. Though I was the designated Ghast defender, we found that at the pace we were moving we could easily dodge the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  That was until we found ourselves at the shores of a Soul Sand swamp. This quagmire sat directly in our path. On one side: sheer cliffs, on the other: a vast pit of fire. We quickly decided it was the only way, and began to</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  It was at this moment a Ghast's pale face reared over the precipice of the cliff. It screeched hideously and began to fire upon us as we slogged through the sandy marshes. At the other end of the sand we could see that there were ruins,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">and we headed for this shelter. AIbatross was inside first, and then myself. But when Toshibi was a short distance from the ruins, he was hit by the shockwave of a ghast's exploding fireball. Despite his<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> injuries, we managed to bring him into the safety</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Toshibi's injuries were fortunately minor, and after a short rest we made our way through the ruins. Upon exiting we were greeted by even more dramatic landscapes . After this point, we had few further encounters with Ghasts. We made</div></div>

We climbed up through a massive ring of Nether stone,  and finally we could not progress further. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  At this time, Toshibi and AIbatross began to dig. Side by side they cut through the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  And lo and behold, as the last bits of Netherrack broke away we could see in plain view the Columbia Nether portal.</div></div>
