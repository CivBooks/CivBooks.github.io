The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.

The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 100</a><div class="page-content">The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which Reactionists so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man's activity can bring about.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 100</a><div class="page-content">The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 100</a><div class="page-content">Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 100</a><div class="page-content">The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property.
