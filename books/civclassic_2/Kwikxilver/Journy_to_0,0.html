<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 23</a><div class="page-content">When i first joined this server, i spawned right next to a forest. At first i was confused when i was not around anyone. I started a home deep within the forest, gathering wood, mining for iron, even a rare diamond or two. Soon after visiting the Reddit page for this server i realized</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 23</a><div class="page-content">i had to travel to see people. So i made me some tools, armour, crafted a stack of bread, and took all of my iron with me to trade. Along with a bunch of other knick knacks.

Soon i was ready to go. I took out all the torches in my house, for the fear of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 23</a><div class="page-content">X-ray'ers seeing it underground due to its light. The first couple of minecraft days were pretty bland. I was running most of the time. I saw some houses, empty of course. A pillaged village too sometimes. Even a rare player or two. I was cautious of other players.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 23</a><div class="page-content">The fear of knowing they could kill me and i could do nothing. So i tended to avoid others. not answering their calls of 'Hello?'. I think it was the 4th day of my travels. I came across a town (Which i now know as The North Pole) and saw a huge tower. I decided to go and investigate this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 23</a><div class="page-content">tower and to my surprise it was a grinde r! There were chest too all along the walls (Mind you this town was griefed and empty so i assumed no one lived here anymore) but sadly they were all locked with iron.  So i did what any other person would do.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 23</a><div class="page-content">I started to use the grinder. But something was wrong. i was on the left side of the grinder (Picture it like a box) and i soon found out there are are tw o holes to grind from! But what i did not know, was the the right side was broken. The mobs could get out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 23</a><div class="page-content">All of a sudden i was hit by an arrow! I freaked out and assumed the worse thinking it was another player! but no, it was something much worse. Of all the times to see this mob, it was a jocky. A Skeleton riding a Spider. Fan-fucking-tastic. I had very little arrows with me. And the thing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 23</a><div class="page-content">was surrounded by other mobs. I tried to run, but two Creepers blocked the doorway. I was hit again by the Jocky while i was hack ing away at the Zombie hoard. I did not carry block with me so i could not build a tiny shield, so i did the next best thing. I started to dig down in hope to bury myself</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 23</a><div class="page-content">and to hide or tunnel out. But to my shock it was protected. I did not have time to mine through a block so i started to dig into the walls. That move turned out to be my downfall. I dug right into the holding pen where the mobs lined up to be hoisted up and dropped to lose their life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 23</a><div class="page-content">To make matters worse the mobs were Skeletons. Vollys and vollys of arrows were shot at me. But i plowed through. Hacking and jumping my life going lower and lower along with my armour litteraly falling off me. I made it to the other side of the spawn room and i started to mine away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 23</a><div class="page-content">But fate had another idea . A creeper came up right behind me. I heard it to. I turned around just in time to put my sword into the defensive position and i prayed to whatever out there that i survive this blast.

During my small prayer i saw an arrow, slowly flying,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 23</a><div class="page-content">and hit the creeper right behind its head. Kil ling it. I was shocked. Even more so when the dead Creeper dropped a Music Disc! (It was Mall) A Skeleton saved me! After that shocking close call i turned right around and finally broke out of that hell hole.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Only to walk out into the night.

I was running again and this time i planned not to stop into buildings anymore. i had to use some of my trading iron to make myself new armour. Food was getting low and i had to hunt animals now. Cooking whenever I got a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 23</a><div class="page-content">chance to rest. Soon i came to the sea. I crafted many boats and i took off, leaving the solid ground.

The 'sea' turned out to be a freaking ocean. A HUGE ocean.  I rode my boat (or better put, dinghy) for days on the water. Not much happened on the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 23</a><div class="page-content">ocean. I came across the few and rare islands. most of them were empty, but a few had some houses. i left signs saying hello and that i found their home. maybe i picked their farms to if they had th em. I replanted! I think it was the 5th day on the water when a storm happened. I thought nothing of it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 23</a><div class="page-content">and jusst went on through. Until of course i was suddenly hit by lighting! My boat was destroyed from under me and i took some damage and started to sink! thankfully i had spare boats so i was able to get on moving again. The rest of the time i was constantly getting near misses by the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 23</a><div class="page-content">lighting! i could have sworn it was trying its best to hit me! But i lived and soon i hit a giant landmass. 

It was sometime on that land where something incredible happened. As always i was running, avoiding people, hunting for food. Even some sight seeing with the great</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 23</a><div class="page-content">land masses. I came upon a huge ravine! (meaning i nearly fell into it) I decided i could restock my iron here and mine it out. So i climed down and started digging. But to my shock once again i found a hole, 2*2 size, that went from the very top all the way down into the ravine!  it was a trap!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 23</a><div class="page-content">And further more there was loot! The poor person who must have fell into the hole had a diamond sword, 12 diamonds, and a bunch of o ther random items! Score! Soon i walked i walked to the famous coords 0,0. I had to climb down into the hole and i set a sign saying "Dezmo55 was here</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 23</a><div class="page-content">July/XX/12" I dont remember the day i reached that spot. I reinforced that sign with stone and that is the end of my journy.</div></div>
