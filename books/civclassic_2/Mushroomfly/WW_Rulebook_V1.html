1. Wool Wars is played
 between two Teams, each with 12 players. Teams will elect their Team Captain and Lieutenant, who will be Player 1 and 7, respectively.
2. Both teams will be given sets of armor. The Team Leader and Lieutenant will wear caps of a-</div></div>

3. Players will be inspected one a time at the Checkpoints before they are allowed into the Play Area. Players are to stash items brought with them in designated Stashes. Referees will inventory check the players by dumping Wooden Shovels-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">-on them to ensure they are not smuggling items into the Play Area. Once a player has been cleared, the Referee assigns them to either the WoolWarsHomeTeam or WoolWarsAwayTeam NameLayer groups, allowing the player to enter the Play Area and their Team Base.
The Team Bases are-</div></div>

Facing the outer wall, the Team Captain's half (Players 1-6) is on the right side of the Team Base, while the Lieutenant's half (Players 7-12) is on the left side. The Teams will set their-</div></div>

5. The following are allowed Wool Wars items: Wool, Wooden Swords, Wooden Axes, Leather or Iron Armor, and Shields. In addition, a sparing amount of Bows,-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">-Crossbows, and ammunition are allowed to be taken by the Team Captain.
7. The match time is twenty (20) minutes. If needed, play can be timed-out for five (5) minutes if a Team Captain informs a Referee a Player requires a pause.
8. The Play Area is divided into a 9x9-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">-grid of square Zones, with each Zone itself being made of 9x9 Blocks. The goal of Wool Wars is to control a majority of the Zones by covering more Blocks in the Zones with a Team's colored Wool than the other Team.
9. A location with Wool on it already can be contested by-</div></div>

The topmost Wool in Block's Stack of Wool is considered the controlling one. However, if a Void (air) is found in a Stack,then the Wool located at the bottom of the Void is instead the controlling block. If the bottom of a-</div></div>

10. PvP is allowed and encouraged to slow the enemy Team's efforts down. Dead players respawn in their Team Base and must resupply.
11. At the end of play, the Referees will create an in-game Map, and then-</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">will go to the objected Zones in order to inspect them more closely. If the investigation proves the other team has won, the Referees will reverse their judgment and discard the Map.
12. The following activites are prohibited: Exploiting, entering the enemy-</div></div>

penalties for violating the rules will range from the offending Player being objected from the ongoing game to the immediate disqualification of the entire Team.</div></div>
