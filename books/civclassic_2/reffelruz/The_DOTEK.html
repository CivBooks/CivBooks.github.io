The Doctrine
of the Eternal King


Printed and nailed to the Westminster Parliament doors on August 9th, 2021.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 21</a><div class="page-content">In the first days of the first world, when the gods dwelt with us upon the earth, and with us made war upon the earth, there came to us great kings worthy in their measure, who shared our mortal burdens and made swift the conquest of heaven.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 21</a><div class="page-content">The lord of all this land, and Her creator, thus being usurped and robbed of His estate, His crown did part between them. The peoples of the new world made war upon the crown for another age, but when the vault doors opened and the stars fell away, none could stand before the End.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 21</a><div class="page-content">One by one, their kingdoms fell, and all was dust before Her.

Her witnesses gave birth to their reflections, but, like enscriptions on the face of the deep, they could not remain, but stretched themselves outward into nothing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 21</a><div class="page-content">The Lord has done a most miraculous and praiseworthy act: the final witness rips devoured life from the belly of the serpent; everything is created from nothing by the hand of God;

Alpha and Omega, One and Zero, Beginning and End - one always</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 21</a><div class="page-content">present, the other forever returning; the reaping and sowing of worlds everpresent, unabated, continues.

How then shall we create the world everlasting? What shall cast the great mother from the garden for eternity?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 21</a><div class="page-content">The answer is nothing, for just as with the Choephori of the Greeks, here, the ancient and destructive goddess must be honored in a world that would be spared from Her absolutely fatal love.

What shall appease the goddess? What shall free</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">the world from Her devouring jaws? As the tale of our God reveals, it is He who cannot be contained who must be devoured.

Kronos, who devoured his children one by one, gave way to their escape upon the unassumed consumption of a stone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Our Peter is that stone, and upon this stone, we build His kingdom - our <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Omphalos<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span><span class="fmtf"><span class="fmtcode">§f</span><span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>, our naval stone, our <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>axis mundi<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>.

This Peter, who first acted as His biblical namesake in defense of His king, has now become the king of the same tale - the chief cornerstone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 21</a><div class="page-content">This Peter who wore the crown into the valley of death, who was bound to the End, in the company of criminals, mocked, crucified and killed at the hands of his captives, in the place where the world was created - this Peter who stood opposite the ancient goddess,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 21</a><div class="page-content">who moved on the face of the waters, who separated the land from the waters, who built a walled garden around the source of life, who banished the wicked from paradise, He who now controls the gates of heaven, this Peter has become one with the Father.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 21</a><div class="page-content">The image of the Water Carrier is He; the acts of God which created worlds may now maintain one forever; the way has been revealed to us.

Through the willing suffering and death of the king, the world was recreated, but not destroyed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Likewise, kingship remained in heaven, whence it came, thus mending the severed connection between heaven and earth established at the dawn of kingship.

Sovereignty, who had forgotten her origin, may now remember her purpose and worship the Lord anew -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 21</a><div class="page-content">the Christ has always been king.

Therefore have we, the people of the Commonwealth, inherited the kingdom of the Lord through Peter, who manifested God on earth, and took the crown to heaven. Should the crown return, by way of selection of the</div></div>

It has been established since the beginning that <span class="fmtn"><span class="fmtcode">§n</span>only the host may bestow the crown<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 21</a><div class="page-content">In the first act of creation, in sacrificing Himself to the End, DREN becomes separated into NAYAH and ANUM, who then create the world. Likewise, our state, established on the sacrifice of the king, is separated into components of spirit and matter:</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Therefore has Peter become our cosmic judge, retaining as He does the keys to heaven and earth. We must become like Him in order to be worthy of Him - to become like Him, we must study His story, and understand what it means for our world: to understand is to rule in His name.</div></div>
