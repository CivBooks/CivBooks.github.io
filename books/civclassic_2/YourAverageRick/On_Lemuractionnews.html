<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>What made him stay on civ was the fact that it had its own literature - he settled in a place called Aytos, which is where he met Oracle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Right next to Aytos was a dead civilization known as Bohemia - an LSIF commune. They were all about literature, and the then curious newfriend fell in love with the dead city's vast index of knowledge, eventually setting up a shop in Aytos.</div></div>

But her story on 2.0 is unknown, unfortunately. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After 2.0 ended Lemur didn't play any iterations of civcraft besides</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>However, he deemed himself unfit to lead, and handed the position to former vice chancellor Hamboy_jr, one of the 5 founders of Columbia.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Lemur and other Columbians gave resources to Tel Aviv and Hallow and helped dig the attack tunnel to the Channer</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Disheartened and spiteful, Channer leadership handed the groups to Mir.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Later in January, the NATO-Mir war erupted, and Columbia was dragged in.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In late-April, he started a "Colexit" petition - for Columbia to negotiate a separate peace deal with Mir. This was sparked by the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It, unfortunately, failed, dooming Columbia to many, many, more months of endless war.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The rest of the Security Council supported the war,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 25</a><div class="page-content">and for month after month on end Lemur tried convincing them to swallow their pride for the greater good.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Around August, he finally did it. He convinced the Security Council to start a vote to end Columbia's war.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content">They soon began negotiating with Mir, and on September 24th, they signed the Treaty of Apoland, officially surrendering to Mir, and saving Columbia.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>His first priority after Columbians came back to Rotterdam was to make up for the many, many,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And it worked! Rotterdam had at least a half dozen builds completed, and he set his eyes on higher</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He, and the rest of Columbia, quickly got to work. Quickly building stadiums in Rotterdam and his fiefdom, Apoland, preparation is far ahead of schedule.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It succeeded far past his expectations, with many, many, books being printed because of this initiative - including this one.</div></div>
