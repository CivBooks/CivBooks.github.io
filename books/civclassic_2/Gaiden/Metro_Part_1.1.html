<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Artyom rose reluctantly from his seat by the fire and, shifting the machine gun from his back to his chest, headed towards the darkness. He stood right at the edge of the lighted area</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and then, as loudly and  threateningly as he could, he clicked the slide on his gun and shouted gruffly, „Stop! Password!‟<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He could hear quick, staccato footsteps in the darkness where moments ago he‟d heard a strange rustle and hollow-sounding</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the fire and flung an answer at Pyotr Andreevich: 'Nope, no one came forward. No resp</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>when have the dark ones ever run off like that? You know it yourself, Pyotr Andreevich. Lately they've been lunging forw</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>big guys, former marines - would stop at the six hundred and eightieth metre. They‟d turn their burning<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">stand stock-still, clinging to their night-vision instruments. And<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>then, they‟d slowly, quietly head back, without taking their eyes off the tunnel, and never turning their<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>to people . . .<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Artyom settled back down into his seat and asked, „So what actually happened at Polezhaevskaya?‟</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Although he already knew this blood-curdling story (from the traders at the station), he had an urge<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>frightening. First their scouts began disappearing. Went off into the tunnels and didn‟t come back.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Granted, their scouts are completely green, nothing like ours,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> but then again, their station‟s smaller, a<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>„And neither the patrols, nor those at the station could see anything, no matter how much light they<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>threw at it. No one appeared - for half an hour,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">then for an hour, then two. They wondered where the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>scouts could have gone - they were only going one kilometre in. They weren‟t allowed to go any<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>further and anyway, they aren‟t total idiots . . . Long story short, they couldn‟t wait to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">find out. They<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>sent reinforcements who searched and searched, and shouted and shouted - but it was all in vain. The<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>patrol was gone. The scouts had vanished. And it wasn‟t just that no one had seen what had happened<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>to them. The worst part was that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">they hadn‟t heard a sound . . . not a sound. There was no trace of them<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Artyom was already beginning to regret that he had asked Pyotr Andreevich to recount the story of<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Polezhaevskaya. Pyotr Andreevich was either better informed, or was</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>somewhat; but in any case, he was telling details of the sort that the traders couldn‟t have dreamed,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>despite being masters and true enthusiasts of story-telling. The story‟s details sent a chill over<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Artyom‟s skin, and he became</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">uncomfortable even sitting next to the fire. Any rustlings from the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>tunnel, even the most innocent, were now exciting his imagination.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>„So, there you have it. They hadn‟t heard any gunfire so they decided that the scouts had simply left<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">were dissatisfied with something, and had decided to run. So, to hell with them. If<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>it‟s an easy life they want, if they want to run around with all kinds of riff-raff, then let them run<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>around to their hearts‟ content. It was simpler to see it that way.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> Easier. But a week later, yet another<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>scout team disappeared. And they weren‟t supposed to go any further than half a kilometre from the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>station. And again, the same old story. Not a sound, not a trace.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Like they‟d vanished into thin air. So<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>then they started getting worried back at the station. Now they had a real mess on their hands - two<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>squadrons had disappeared within a week. They‟d have to do something about it. Meaning, they‟d have<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">measures. Well, they set up a cordon at the three-hundredth metre. They dragged sandbags to<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the cordon, set up machine guns and a spotlight - according to the rules of fortification. They sent a<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>some kind of accident. Conditions there had become unliveable, and everyone had fled. „Anyway, then they sent</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the people there were still considering their answer - when a</div></div>
