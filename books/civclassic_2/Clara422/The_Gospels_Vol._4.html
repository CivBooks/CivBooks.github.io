Enter in the city and get you to an upper room furnished. And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. And he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 44</a><div class="page-content">took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: For I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{63} And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. And as soon as it was day, the elders and the chief priests and scribes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 44</a><div class="page-content">came together, and led him into their council, saying, Art thou the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. And they said, What need we further witness? for we have heard of his own mouth.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, repented himself, and brought his thirty pieces of silver to the temple, saying; I have betrayed innocent blood, and departed, and went and hanged himself.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{15} Now at that feast the governor was wont to release a prisoner. Therefore when the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 44</a><div class="page-content">people were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for one Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. And the governor said, What evil hath he done?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 44</a><div class="page-content">But they cried out, Let him be crucified.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{24} When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 44</a><div class="page-content">{26} Then released he Barabbas: and scourged Jesus, and delivered him to be crucified. And the soldierrs stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. And they platted a crown of thorns, and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 44</a><div class="page-content">mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{32} And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull. And they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 44</a><div class="page-content">crucified him, and parted his garments among them by casting lots. And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. And</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 44</a><div class="page-content">they that passed by reviled him, saying, If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{45} Now there was darkness over all the land and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 44</a><div class="page-content">God, why hast thou forsaken me? And Jesus yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain; and the earth did quake; And the graves were opened; and many saints which slept arose. Now when the centurion watching Jesus saw those</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 44</a><div class="page-content">things, he said, Truly this was the Son of God.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{57} When the even was come Joseph of Arimathaea went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. And Joseph had the body wrapped in clean linen, and laid it in a new tomb hewn out in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 44</a><div class="page-content">rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door, and departed.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Now upon the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James came unto the sepulchre, and found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. And they entered in, and found not the body of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 44</a><div class="page-content">Lord Jesus. And as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen. And they returned unto the eleven.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{11} But their words</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 44</a><div class="page-content">seemed as idle tales. Then Peter ran unto the sepulchre; and beheld the grave clothes. And two disciples went that day to a village called Emmaus. And Jesus himself drew near, and went with them, but they knew him not. And at the village, they said, take</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 44</a><div class="page-content">meat with us. And he took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished from their sight.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{24} And they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 44</a><div class="page-content">gathered together, saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. And as they spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. But they were terrified and supposed that they had seen a spirit. And he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 44</a><div class="page-content">said, Behold my hands and my feet: handle me, and see. Have ye here any meat? And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and an honeycomb. And he took it, and did eat before them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 44</a><div class="page-content">Matthew 28<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{11} ... some of the watchmen came into the city, and told these things unto the chief priests<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{12} and the elders took counsel and they gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying, Say ye, His disciples</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 44</a><div class="page-content">came by night, and stole him away while we slept.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>[15] So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{22} And he breathed on them, saying; Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
