He was now alt-banned, just like everyone else in his crew. They had a good run in their eyes, but PapaPound still felt</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 35</a><div class="page-content"> like he could have done more. Maybe he did want total ruin to come to the server by his own hand.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Not like it mattered anymore. It was over. His reign was done and he did enough damage to cement himself a name along with the rest of the shitheads</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 35</a><div class="page-content">who fucked with Civcraft. Even though he was in the End, he still stood with his chest puffed out like some love-crazed bird, proud of what he had accomplished.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Papa was working on his end base when his chat alerted him to someone picking his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 35</a><div class="page-content">pearl up out of the chest he was trapped in. Clone2204. What did he want now? He was probably going to summon him and gloat about how he was defeated now, which seemed like something Clone would do. Soon enough, Papa was summoned, his items left strewn on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 35</a><div class="page-content"> the ground in the End. Bright light attacked his eyes and Papa cringed from it, a hand trying to block it out. After he adjusted, he looked up to see Clone standing there smirking, pearl in hand.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Hello, Papa.” His smirk grew. “How are you?”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 35</a><div class="page-content">PapaPound stayed silent, sure that if he said one thing it would turn the situation into <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>something different. Instead, he declined to answer, choosing to ask his own question.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Why’d you summon me?”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Mmmm, I think you know why.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 35</a><div class="page-content">  He did, but something about <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>today...Something<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> about Clone seemed different. Clone had a gleam in his eye like never before, as if he had something planned. “What is your suggestion today?” Papa questioned as he eyed Clone in his enchanted diamond armor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 35</a><div class="page-content">“Well, I had a few ideas, but firstly,” He held up a lead, just like the ones for horses, “I’m <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>tying you up.”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Papa had never really thought about getting tied up. Personally, he had never liked being tied down, metaphorically</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 35</a><div class="page-content">or literally, but the way Clone suggested it... more like ordered it… already Papa was interested. He’d never admit it, but he loved to be ordered around. The only other person who knew was Clone and of course, he always took advantage of it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 35</a><div class="page-content">  Clone knotted the last few bit of rope and Papa was tied to a fence, on his knees. He glanced up at Clone, his face slightly flushed considering he was right in front of Clone’s crotch. “What are we doing first... Sir?” Clone’s bottom lip was trapped</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 35</a><div class="page-content">between his teeth as soon as Papa referred to him as ‘Sir’. God, he loved when he said that to him. “I think you can suck my cock, darling.” He unbuttoned his pants and stepped closer, unzipping them and pulled out his trouser snake. Papa smirked as Clone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 35</a><div class="page-content">rubbed his cock against his face, not letting him actually start. Clone teased him just a bit longer before he held himself out, pumping to get stiff. Papa licked and lapped at the tip of Clone’s penis before it was shoved into his mouth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 35</a><div class="page-content">  It may have seemed harsh, but Papa loved it. His cheeks hollowed as he went to town on Clone’s meat, enjoying every bit of it, rolling his tongue on the underside. He gagged briefly and Clone pulled out of his mouth, checking to see if Papa was alright.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 35</a><div class="page-content">The vault breaker nodded and opened his mouth, ready for more. Clone stuffed his dick back into Papa’s gaping mouth, trying to resist the urge to thrust into his mouth.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  After a few moans, Clone couldn’t help himself, his hand that was laying gently on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Papa’s head curled into a fist, grabbed hair and he thrust forward into the other’s mouth. It felt so good, so he did it again and again. He could hear Papa gag hard a few times as his cock went down his throat, but the hums from the bound man</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 35</a><div class="page-content">solidified that he was enjoying it.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Suddenly Clone pulled out gasping, trying not to cum. A few coughs came from the criminal as he licked his lips, looking thoroughly pleased. He looked up to the Rush fan and grinned, "Can you last long enough</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 35</a><div class="page-content">to fuck me?”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Clone laughed, “Fuck yeah!” He untied Papa and shoved him over the fence.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>”Wait, wait wait…” Papa suddenly said. Clone stopped and stepped away, thinking he overstepped the line. “I want you to tie me up again. I want you</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 35</a><div class="page-content">to not touch me. I want you to pound me so hard.”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Clone’s eyes widened. This wasn’t like Papa, he was never this demanding before. “Are you sure?”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Please, Sir. Please fuck me hard.”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Clone swallowed down a moan, not letting Papa know how hot</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 35</a><div class="page-content">that made him.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Soon, Papa was tied up again. Hands behind his back and face in the dirt. Oh, how he felt like a dirty little slut with his ass in the air. Lube dripped from a bottle hitting his ass and slipping between the crack. Clone smeared it over</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 35</a><div class="page-content">his hole, using his fingers to slip some inside.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“How does that feel?”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Good. Very good, would be better if it was your dick.”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Soon, babe.”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  A finger slipped inside Papa and teased him. It felt good, but he didn't need to be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 35</a><div class="page-content">stretched. He wasn’t new to this. “Will you just stick your cock in already?!” Clone smirked, deciding instead to tease Papa terribly. He continued probing him with one finger as Papa continued to writhe and complain. Eventually Clone made it to two, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Papa still whined. Clone kept going, a terrible grin growing on his face with every additional grumble from the outlaw.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  When he finally slipped in a third finger, Papa lost it. “Oh, please Clone. Stop fucking teasing me and just fuck me! Please!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 35</a><div class="page-content">I’m on the fucking edge and you won’t let me fucking blow my load. Your skinny pencil fingers aren’t getting me anywhere!” Clone started howling with laughter, it must have been how desperate Papa sounded. He felt bad for laughing, because he didn't</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 35</a><div class="page-content">mean to, but it just came out. “I’m sorry, okay?”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Don’t fucking apologize. Shut the hell up and stick me, you cock.”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Clone obliged by pouring more lube on and getting ready. He spread Papa apart and slipped his hardened sword into</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 35</a><div class="page-content">the other’s quivering, waiting love hole. A sigh of relief and pleasure shuddered from Papa as Clone began to slowly thrust into him. The coolpvper thrust deep, finding Papa’s prostate and ramming into it. Papa wailed in ecstasy as he rocked back into</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Clone trying to get more of it. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The Rush superfan leaned forward to whisper into Papa’s ear. “Call me a dirty collaborator, because I love giving you my goods.” He quickened his pace, because he could feel Papa shaking  underneath</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 35</a><div class="page-content">him, just ready to explode. Papa began to beg again, “Faster, Clone. For fuck sake, faster, I need to cum! Make me cum!”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  him, just ready to explode. Papa began to beg again, “Faster, Clone. For fuck sake, faster, I need to cum! Make me cum!” He knew</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 35</a><div class="page-content">deep down, Papa loved it too. He loved being degraded and fucked and talked down to. What Clone didn’t know, was Papa knew the secret to making Clone blow his load too early. There was one thing in the entire world that Clone could not resist.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 35</a><div class="page-content">And that was Rush.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Papa began to sing in a strained voice, it wasn’t loud, but it was just enough for Clone to hear over his huffing. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice. If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 35</a><div class="page-content">“oOOOH MY GOD” Clone exclaimed. He stopped thrusting for a brief second in shock, but then he was ready. He was going to cum. He started fucking Papa, absolutely pounding him.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill I will choose a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 35</a><div class="page-content">path that's clear!”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Finally, the two of them came at the same exact time, jizz was everywhere. Papa’s thighs were soaked and it was dripping out his ass. Clone pulled out, slightly slumped over Papa. They were both breathless, but Clone managed to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 35</a><div class="page-content">quietly sing out, <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
