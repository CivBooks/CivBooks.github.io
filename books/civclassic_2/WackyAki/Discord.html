<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 13</a><div class="page-content">There are structural problems with Discord. Both in the metagame and for civilizations growth in game. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Meta gamers are a cancer on the civ genre, but thats a topic for another book. Discord does not only encourage metagaming, but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">it practically forces players to become metagamers. With the phone app, a website and pushed notifications, every player with discord is constantly connected to the other players in your nation. There is no more "Unavailable" for any player.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Further, discord also often hosts entire communication networks between nations, so now someone who only plays once a week can have tangible effects on communications and relationships between nations. Even intrastate policy and elections can be run</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">on discord, which completely removes the obligation to play the game in order to have an effect on policy. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Second, Discord is a seriously broken app or website. The app constantly crashes in the middle of VC and oftentimes messages get double sent.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">This doesnt include the numerous times images dont load properly on the app or website or when discord is down region or nationwide. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This also doesnt bode well for civilizations in game for growth. Early civilizations often use discord to facilitate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">communication amongst themselves and with other nations. However, this just stifles growth, as if you play civ to hang out with your friends then its just easier to talk on discord. Nations also stagnate if no one plays in the game and slowly it simply</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">easier to be a metagamer and talk on discord than it is to play the game and communicate thusly. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Finally, discord is a heaven send to authoritarians. You see, discord has the ability to allow the server owner to mute or ban certain people from your</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">server. It also allows for bots with high level access to simply run a script that deletes any series of words that it detects. This can be used to the benefit of the user to remove spam messages and NSFW content. However, theres nothing stopping someone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">from making the bot delete dissenting opinions. Perhaps someone could use this function to servermute political opponents in VC and delete any messages advocating for the removal of whoever owns the bot from power. Similarly, the owner of a bot can</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">send messages in support of a political candidate or party and drown out the opposition candidates. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The reason this is so disturbing is that one programmer, or simply someone who can copy/paste code, can achieve power through what could be a nations</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">sole means of communications. This could spread to other servers or someone could send a bot for one nation to use and use that bot to get their own candidate to win the elections of another nation. This could turn into a form of communications hegemony.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">So what's the answer? What does a nation do? Well, first, its important to decentralize the means of communication. Use discord, but also use sykpe, mumble, even in game chat at times. Prioritize DM's and use subreddits for announcements. Also, its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 13</a><div class="page-content">important to sometimes disconnect. Dont download the app and at the very least turn off push notifications. Real life comes first.</div></div>
