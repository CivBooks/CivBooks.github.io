<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>and said, "You asked,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>so I came." I blushed,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

As he guided me in we were almost pressed against one another. Once inside, I gasped… the city looked amazing and just so dense, the shops were numerous,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">the people were many, and the chat was so active! Then I hear a voice, "HI GUYS! Uuhm, have you guys been to Southshire? We've got a new shop in Shopshire so you should totally come and buy shit!" Bg turns to me with that lopsided smile and it gives me</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Ow!" I exclaim, an arrow just hit me.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt4"><span class="fmtcode">§4</span>You have engaged in  <span class="fmt4"><span class="fmtcode">§4</span>combat with <span class="fmtb"><span class="fmtcode">§b</span>XCstar<span class="fmt4"><span class="fmtcode">§4</span>.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I turn around, filled with rage but bg stops me, his hand on my arm but I do not notice.</div></div>

It wasn't convincing, but I start to notice bg's touch and I can feel his heat and it sends shivers up my body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">He leads me once again, but this time we end up in a dark, dank alleyway and I become anxious. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>What is bg     <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>about to do?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> But as if on cue he says that this is his house.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Haha," I laugh nervously.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We both go in through the front door and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">he almost immediately tells me how this is the oldest unmodified building in Yoahtl.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Oh, that's so interesting, bg."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In the middle of the room was a double bed, but the walls were covered in picture frames of leads and saddles.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I didn't know</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Oh no," he said back with his trademark inflection. "All this is just for animal husbandry." But the glint in his eye was unmistakable though, and I was drawn to it.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We sat down</div></div>

He pushes against me so that I fall onto my back, where he starts to remove my pitiful iron chestpiece and leggings, which were almost broken anyway.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then he starts to</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>My heart was beating a mile a minute, but I can feel my legs widening, wanting him, inviting him...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 15</a><div class="page-content">He moves towards me with a desire that sends me wild, and he turns me over and takes me from behind.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Shill for me, bg!" I practically scream. "Shill for me!"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It takes me over the edge and we explode together as one, it was pure bliss.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As we lay there, spent and sweaty with the heat of sex, I turn to him and say,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
