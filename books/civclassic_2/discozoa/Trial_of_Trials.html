Instead, the Bog Knight was transported northwards by a mysterious and unfamiliar force. Looking hither and thither, he found himself in Augsburg, territory of the</div></div>

Remembering from a previous northern expecdition, he began his trek southwards. Crossing a river, he found an isle of Gensokyo and needing a rest, settled. There he created the Hut of the Lost and lamented his situation. Still, he embarked southwards.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">The next land he came across was the so called Tvtopia, where strange gliphs and truly gargantuan artwork was displayed. He marvelled at the great structures, yet he continued southwards. The Bog Knight knew that directly south of this land would be he Truidencian mainland.</div></div>

Unbeknownst to him, a fiendish hooligan had set his abode ablaze. As soon as he entered, he was consumed by flame. Now returned to that strange land of Romans in the north, he was peeved. Now knowing the path home,</div></div>

By Tvtopia, Imperial Bay and the Truidencian Sea, he returned and extinguished the flames, only to find his maps, many valuables and bed gone. At this sight he was demoralized significantly, yet knew that he had to push</div></div>
