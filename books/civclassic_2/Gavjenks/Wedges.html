Daddy1015 was walking along, having just bought a large sum of emerald blocks from Captain_Teach. Suddenly, he heard a yell from the canals below. "WHY THE FUCK DOES EVERY CITY IN THE COMMONWEALTH</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">HAVE CANALS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING ROAD". It was a familiar voice, that of trevie303. His sexy bacon skin was familiar, although it was difficult to tell as its resemblance to a sexy burn victim was uncanny. "FUCK THESE STUPID CANALS" he yelled, as</div></div>

He furiously alt-tabbed into Discord, and wrote a message<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

Daddy happily obliged. Daddy ripped the panties off of trevie's skin, and began to slobber furiously, except there was nothing because this is fucking electronic lego.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 10</a><div class="page-content">He kept sucking on  his 8 inch blaze rod, until he began to climax. "OH DADDY." he yelled and moaned at the same time. "PILLAR IN MY ASSHOLE NEXT, IN RETURN". Daddy happily obliged there too. He pulled out his humongous wedge, and began to place it in his</div></div>

He began to drop a load on Daddy's chest, and performed the finest Cleveland Steamer known to man. despite apparently being from Illinois. The mix of cum and shit made</div></div>
