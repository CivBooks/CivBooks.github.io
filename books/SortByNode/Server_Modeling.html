<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">It is my opinion that this server has been a resounding success, as far as its goals of modeling civilization go. It has successfully modeled human nature, in multiple situations<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">and times.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Already, the rise and fall of civilization(s) has been modeled successfully, and<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">with surprising accuracy.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Take for example, what I'll refer to as the Golden Age. This was the start of the server, when cities</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">rose from the wilderness and an entire world was connected by fast transport. Trade flourished, and so did the cities that became nexus of trade. They grew larger, more complex, richer.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">But all things must come to an end.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">The HCF played the part of many barbarians before them, striking cities and trade routes, leveling buildings and monuments renowned the world over. They killed and pillaged, and burned and looted. They, among other things, caused the destruction or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">abandonment of multiple cities. The World Police fell before them, and with it the last vestiges of a world wide civilization.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">People began to run into the wilderness to hide, or to the more militant and/or secret cities.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Civilization collapsed in large swaths of land, relatively over night. New towns and villages were settled in the wilderness, many of the old roads and cities abandoned.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">In some of them, squatters took up residence, while others stayed eerily silent.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">So, what does this successfully model? Well, it models a few things quite well. The game starts, cities are built, trade established. Certain cities become the centers of trade because of their position. This models real world trade in the days before</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">cars and planes really well.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">But some of the best modeling came from, ironically, the fall of civilization. As we know from our own history, wherever there is a great concentration of wealth, prestige, or power someone will rise to try to take it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Look at what happened in Rome, and what the Mongols did in China. The HCF were this server's Mongols and Vandals. They came and raided the cities, took the wealth that had first attracted them. When they came, people fled. This too is an accurate model.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">When a feared force comes, people have a tendency to run. This happened all over the server.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Now, there are continual rumblings of a "Resistance." However, it never seems to gain enough steam to succeed because people don't</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">seem to care enough. This is an accurate model as well. We have a tendency to take the "sit by and do nothing" attitude when the situation doesn't affect us, and that is what is happening here. What's more, people don't want to risk losing all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">that they own after dying. That's even more of a concern here, because after death/imprisonment the player has to struggle though life in the End.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">There is one more suprisingly accurate model. Look at what recently happened to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Mt Augusta. McFluffyKittens attempted to take the city over by force. Note the words "take over." It wasn't a simple attempt to destroy, or simply raid. It was an attempt to CONQUER. Here, we see something like what the Vandals and Mongols did.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">They raided, and raided, and raided until they started to conquer. Then, they built up their own kingdoms after carving up the older civilizations there. That is what is happening here.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Of course, time may reveal this last</div></div>
