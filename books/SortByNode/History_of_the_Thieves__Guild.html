Please treat this book with respect and know that all information within is yours alone. All names have been changed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 30</a><div class="page-content">As most great things, the Thieves' Guild had humble beginnings.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It began merely as the dream of two brothers in arms, looking for a new life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 30</a><div class="page-content">A life of adventure and success, taking wealth from the rich and privileged and lowering them to the level of the common man. The first step to the foundation was to get the necessary capital to begin, leading to the first heist.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We robbed as much as we could and left fat and happy, but without a place to store our goods. We used a local tavern as our temporary base of operations. We built some chests and buried them to keep them safe and secure from prying eyes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 30</a><div class="page-content">until we got a more permanent residence. For our base, we had to find somewhere hidden, but still nearby. We finally settled on hiding it beneath a deep lake at the bedrock. It's a decent place, two bedrooms, an entry hall, and a modest melon farm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We have one room dedicated to exceptional loot with a cart going around it. Once the base was set up, we went out for another round of robbery. On this heist, we again went to Aristopolis.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We targeted every large house and stole everything that wasn't bolted to the floor. We went into a large tower via a dirt tower we built and began rummaging around. I remained up top and stole what was there whilst CockBane rummaged around below.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 30</a><div class="page-content">One local law enforcement agent spotted him, inquiring as to who the proper owner of the house was. I jumped and landed in the water and quickly began speeding away while CockBane attempted to follow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We managed to escape unpearled, but we had been branded as thieves. We tried to wait in the guild until it all blew over, but it seemed as though they weren't going to stop looking.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We finally decided it would be best just to turn ourselves in and take the pearling after CockBane was pearled while attempting further theft. The End is dull, painfully so. There are many people, but nothing else but endstone and endermen.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 30</a><div class="page-content">There was no wood or anything else from which to build anything. When finally we were unpearled, we just went back to our life of crime, but were more cautious this time. There's a war now, between the HCF and the CivCrafters.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 30</a><div class="page-content">It's taken the entire world by surprise, griefers run rampant and there's not enough police to stop them all. This seems like a perfect time to loot where they've been, cleaning up after them, but they would take all the blame.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We now loot as opportunity allows and have accumulated a small fortune consisting of a few stacks of rail, numerous stacks of stone and netherrack as well as netherbrick, countless stacks of melon, numerous</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 30</a><div class="page-content">diamond weapons and tools, all of powerful enchantment, three enchanted bows, three stacks of redstone, two stacks of iron, and 19 diamonds, all of which are hidden within our base behind locked chests.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Our fortune is modest, but will only grow as we buy nothing and continually increase our stock through theft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We may eventually set up shops to sell unneeded materials, mostly stolen, to give our members a more public and respectable face. We may even become involved in politics eventually and control a small hamlet.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We don't, however, plan to expand our membership as it is not certain that the recruits would be trustworthy enough to know our location and have access to our loot.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 30</a><div class="page-content">The current member list is as follows:<span class="fmt0"></span>

<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We are currently working on turning LittleBrother into an asset, buying him land in various high-value cities so we could be allowed in without attracting too much attention.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 30</a><div class="page-content">He currently resists, saying he will not help us steal from innocent people, but we think he can be turned. Money corrupts morals given enough time. Those who would pass up an opportunity at free land in abundance are few and far between.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 30</a><div class="page-content">If he will not do it, we will find someone else, someone more yielding in their beliefs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We have gained our first asset today, LittleBrother. His morals did crumble slightly and he is our inside man. He currently only has housing in Aristopolis but we are looking into land in other cities as well,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 30</a><div class="page-content">though Aristopolis seems to be the best due to its balance of wealth and low security. Though the guards are paranoid, they only watch the portal and there are many other ways in.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Leningrad is long abandoned, but still full of resources. It's a great place to loot since no one even cares about it.</div></div>
