<span class="fmt0">-------------------<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The shaft descended into darkness further than I could see.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">I had stumbled across it while surveying some penguin colonies with my research team. None of us were able to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 33</a><div class="page-content">source its origins, it was a stateless landmark. We thought it was some forgotten bunker or even the top of a lost submarine, but upon opening it we realized it was much more.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">At first we just shouted down the tube. The icy wind hid any echoed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 33</a><div class="page-content">response we might have heard. We dropped a few bits of ice only to see them clatter down the steel sides of pipe and ladder that scaled with it. We agreed to leave it alone, and so we did. Or at least, the others did.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I couldn't ignore</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 33</a><div class="page-content">it. I knew the others were curious too, but nowhere near as much as me. What was it? No one had been building here, and the ice is dated back at least 350 years. I went back to it often, dropping fluorescent glow-sticks down it in an attempt to see</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 33</a><div class="page-content">the bottom, but to no avail. I couldn't visit it in the night or I'd freeze to death, so I had to sneak breaks in during the little sunlight we had.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Finally my curiosity got the better of my judgement. I promised myself I wouldn't go down it, but I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 33</a><div class="page-content">couldn't resist the temptation of finding out what secrets the hatch might hold.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">With a bag of supplies suspended to my back, I clambered down the pipe. I opted to leave the latch open lest it freeze over during a storm. I climbed down the ladder for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 33</a><div class="page-content">at least 20 minutes before I took any break. I took out another glow-stick and dropped it. With the darkness above me and the howls of the wind now quiet, I was able to see it go much further than from the surface, but still, nothing. No sign of a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 33</a><div class="page-content">bottom. No clang of the stick hitting any metal, or splashing into any water. I tied a glow-stick to my place on the ladder and began to climb back up to the surface.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I continued these expeditions almost daily. Every day I'd climb further, faster, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 33</a><div class="page-content">for nothing. No rooms, no changes in the design. Just a steel tube drilling down into the glacier. After about 2 hours of descending it became too hot for my acclimatized gear. I'd leave it tied at the same spot every time, waiting for my return</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 33</a><div class="page-content">ascension. It was warmer, but it made it a lot easier to climb without all of that gear. But even with the added nimbleness it seemed my efforts were futile. That was until about 1 month after my initial journey.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It was the end of my descent, about 3</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 33</a><div class="page-content">hours down. I was getting ready to go back up when I did my routine glow-stick drop. I had been neglecting to do it to stave my disappointment, and I didn't expect anything to come of it. I dropped it lamely and began to climb back up when from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 33</a><div class="page-content">below me I heard a distant clink. I stopped immediately. My entire body froze up. I didn't imagine it. It had hit something. I looked over my shoulder and down to see a faint light far below me. Any thoughts of the surface world left me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 33</a><div class="page-content">I fumbled down the ladder as quick as possible, letting myself drop 10 feet at a time, scraping my hands against the cold steel as I slid down. My excitement was palpable, my heart was in my throat. A month of explorations would finally have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 33</a><div class="page-content">meaning. The light grew closer, I could see the bottom where it lay, and then suddenly my feet rested beside it. I had reached the bottom of the ladder. I picked up the glow-stick, and saw much more space than I imagine I'd see. I through it as hard as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 33</a><div class="page-content">I could, and from the low light I was able to make out the shape of the room I had found.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It was a rectangular room, the size of an average living room I guess. The walls, floor, and ceiling were of the same metallic material as both the ladder and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 33</a><div class="page-content">tube that led me there. I took out my flashlight and shone it around. The bright light blinded me for a moment, but through my squinting eyes I was able to make out a door straight ahead of me. It had no handle or hinges visible. Only upon me walking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 33</a><div class="page-content">closer to it did I see the panel directly right of it. A flat metal sheet with a single unlabelled button on it. My heart was beating faster than it ever had before. In all the time I had been between the steel walls of the tube I had never felt fear,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 33</a><div class="page-content">not once. But now I had the option. To see what was ahead, or return back to where I came from. No one would blame me for it. My curiosity was quenched, I'd found the bottom. I could climb back to the surface and live a long life with the knowledge that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 33</a><div class="page-content">the hole ended somewhere. All of these thoughts raced through my head as I extended my hand outwards and pushed the button.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">For a moment there was silence. I stood back expecting something horrible, something</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 33</a><div class="page-content">unimaginable to happen, but after a few seconds the doors simply slid apart to reveal a brightly lit room much smaller than the one I was in now. I was not turning back. I stepped in and looked around. Before I am able to take in any detail the doors</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 33</a><div class="page-content">close behind me. I slam my hands on them, attempting to pry it open but there's no use. I stand back and begin to panic. What if I was trapped here? No one would know where I went. I would die here alone and be forgotten. The room shakes. I brace myself</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 33</a><div class="page-content">along the wall as I feel myself beginning to descend. The sound of the mechanics were very quiet, though by the feeling of the blood rushing to my head I knew I was falling very fast. I nearly pass out before I feel the elevator slow itself down.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Shortly after I feel it rest to a halt. The doors open, and I step out.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I am in a room of unimaginable size. I can't see the roof or the walls, only the elevator shaft behind me piercing into the sky. The only light comes from the open door behind</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 33</a><div class="page-content">me and the pedestal about twenty meters in front of me. I slowly walk up to it to examine it further. There's no turning back now, even if I could make it back to the surface before the night's freezing storms consumed me. I walked right up to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 33</a><div class="page-content">pedestal to find only two things on top of it. A small switch, and a folded card that says "The world." I pick up the card to look more closely as I hear the sound of footsteps coming from beyond the pedestal. I drop the card and back away slowly before</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 33</a><div class="page-content">seeing a figure emerge from the darkness. My eyes widen in horror before I realize what I see.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I see myself.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">He looks at me, into me. I tilt my head and he does too. Is it mocking me? No, it has a look of intrigue as it surveys my face.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 33</a><div class="page-content">I find my voice and call out to it.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Who are you?" I pathetically yell.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Who are you?" It curtly yells back, almost annoyed.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">It walks around the pedestal and towards me. I fumble backwards and fall onto the cold stone beneath me. It is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 33</a><div class="page-content">steps away from my cowering body.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"What do you want?" I manage to squeak out at it.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The creature crouches down and stares at me with reptilian eyes. It leans in, over my body, and whispers into my ear.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"I need about tree fiddy."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Now it was about this time that I realized that this supposed clone was actually a three story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era. That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 33</a><div class="page-content">I scramble backwards along the ground and stand up. I yell "God damn it monster you ain't getting my tree fiddy!"<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I turn around and return back to the elevator that brought me down here. As the doors slide closed I can see the creature</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 33</a><div class="page-content">looking downwards in defeat.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Within a few minutes I am back to the ladder, and a few hours later I reach the surface. But there is no light to greet me. The hatch is open to reveal a storm unlike one we had faced yet</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 33</a><div class="page-content">here in the antarctic.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I can only hope someone comes and finds me here. I am too weak to climb down, and too cold to hold on for much longer.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">I close my eyes as the darkness takes me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 33</a><div class="page-content">E.D.<span class="fmt0"></span>
