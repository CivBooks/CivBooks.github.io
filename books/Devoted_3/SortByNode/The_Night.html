<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 25</a><div class="page-content">As the glimmering sun faded lazily over the horizon, Steve tore his gilded hatchet from the redwood he had been chopping.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He gazed in agitation as the silvery light of the moon began to bathe the forest in an eerie glow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 25</a><div class="page-content">They would come, he was sure of it. He could already hear the deadly clinking of bones, the rattling hisses of the spiders. Panic filled him like water, he could feel the fear and terror welling up within.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Ghostly moans of pain floated through the crisp air of the night. As the guttural zombie groans reached his ears, his head cleared, and his heart filled with steel determination.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The clicking and clacking of bones grew closer, and an arrow whizzed past his head. The hunt was on. He ran, whipping through branches and bushes, the steel points of arrows impaling in trunks inches from his head.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 25</a><div class="page-content">A tall, midnight black figure leapt at him from behind a tree, eerie purple smoke drifting from its hide. He felt its talons graze his shoulder, leaving a stinging cut. Blood trickled as he ran, leaving a crimson trail in his wake.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 25</a><div class="page-content">A spider dropped like chain lightning from the foliage, clamping it's salivating fangs around Steve's forearm.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He fell into a roll, feeling grim satisfaction as the spider's frail body crunched under him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He winced as he surveyed the oozing puncture marks in his arm. Poisoned, but treatment would have to wait. He continued his lung searing sprint. He burst out of the woods at record speed, taking a pond in his stride.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 25</a><div class="page-content">A mountain loomed overhead, a good place to get his bearings. Exhausted, he jogged to the peak. He could see the welcoming torchlight of his house, and relaxed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Too soon. As he glanced fleetingly over his shoulder, he feared for his life.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A score of vile creatures shot from the undergrowth, scaling the mountain upon which he stood.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Spiders, with the hair bristling on their lengthy legs, fixed their gleaming red eyes upon him, letting him know that he would be their next meal. Skeleton archers notched arrows to their bows, drawing back the strings to their bony jawlines.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Zombies stumbled ever onward, moaning and dripping blood, their reek arousing fear in Steve like he had never known. He was going to make it home, he had to.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 25</a><div class="page-content">But panic rose inside him as he realised that the only way to descend the mountain was through the bloodthirsty mob.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In an act of desperation, he drew his sword. It was three feet long, iron, with a deep blood channel and a leather wrapped hilt.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 25</a><div class="page-content">A diamond was set into the pommel stone. Every two inches down the length of the shining blade was a spike, curved towards the tip in a wicked point, progressively smaller the farther away from the handle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content">As Steve pulled the blade from his scabbard, he felt courage flow through him. He took up a battle stance, and as the first zombie lumbered within reach, Steve swung the blade in a crescent moon.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The undead warrior collapsed to the ground in two. Feeling reckless, Steve charged the army as bloodlust turned his vision to crimson. He plunged his blade through a spider, and tore it out as the arachnid fell to the earth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He then spun to face behind him, his blade crunching the ribs of a skeleton. He expertly hooked the spikes of his sword around its spine, and as he twirled, flung the shattered bones of the archer into the oncoming mob.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He bellowed a battle cry, thrusting his weapon deep through a zombie's belly. He whipped it out in a semicircle, flicking blood into the eyes of his enemies. He was going to triumph. He knew it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 25</a><div class="page-content">As he slashed downwards with the force of a moving train, cleaving several undead in half, he froze. He<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>had seen a flash of green behind him, but no, it had to be an illusion. It couldn't be-<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"SssssSSsss..."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The creeper stepped forward. Steve was petrified. Just at the last second, he came to his senses and bolted for the edge of the cliff. The sun was just peaking up behind the trees, and the undead monsters would burn.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 25</a><div class="page-content">But the creeper would remain.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Steve peered over the sickening drop to the bottom of the cliff, looking for water, and saw none. The creeper came closer. All the water in the world couldn't save him from his fate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 25</a><div class="page-content">There is no evading destiny. A sharp hiss began behind him. He dove over the edge of the mountain, twisting around and piercing the rocks with his blade. As it skidded through the stony mountainside, dislodging pebbles and dirt, his fall slowed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He saw the head of the creeper peering down at him, daring him to fight. He swallowed down his fear, vaulting up over his sword and pulling it from the rock. As he fell, unprotected, he cast the sword upwards.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 25</a><div class="page-content">It impaled the creeper, causing it to stagger backwards, then tumbling, rolling down the cliff and coming to a rest at the bottom with Steve's sword in<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>its head.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Steve felt strangely at peace as he fell, and then he smacked the bottom with a sickening thump. His broken body stared at the sunrise as his eyes glazed over. Tribute to a brave warrior, Steve had fallen.</div></div>
