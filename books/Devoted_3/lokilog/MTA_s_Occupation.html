They recently left Devoted to settle is Civclassics, a newer civ server. But before that, Mt Augusta was one of the biggest, most powerful nations on the</div></div>

They had recently annexed the southern nation of Three Kings, and their borders spread far north and west of captial. It was during this time, however, that many new raiders were popping up all over the server. And, on the night of January 6th,</div></div>

They claimed to be part of an 'invisible nation' which means that they owned no land, but still had members.

That day, one of my friends, Supa_Hot_Fire and I lead an attack on the raider who had been left to overlook the city: Impulca. In the previous year, Impulca had gone to Mt Augusta only to kill a citizen, take his stuff, and leave. Supa and I lost</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>2: Mount Augusta was a very powerful nation, and by taking it over, it would weaken it's public image</div></div>

But besides that, there were a few more changes made. First of all,</div></div>
