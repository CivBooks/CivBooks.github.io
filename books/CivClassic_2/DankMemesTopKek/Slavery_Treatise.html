<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">To work is to be alive.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A man finds purpose through his work.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Be it through building, mining, or harvesting the fields, a man must work. Some men find themselves working to protect their nation in the field of war.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">All work sows the seeds of product. Mining begets minerals, farming begets food, building begets homes and shops. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And war, war begets pearled players.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">All citizens benefit from eachother's work. Builders produce the houses the citizenry lives in, and the shops the merchants sell from and the customers buy from. Miners produce the materials used for tools, armor, weapons, and currency.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">And so it should stand to reason that war, too, would benefit the citizenry. But that simply isn't the case. As it stands, war is a meaningless toil resulting in nothing but survival and an artificial "dominance".</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">But it doesn't have to be this way. In war, dozens of people are pearled and simply shoved into vaults to be permapearled until whenever their captors decide to free them. Their worth is only their non-presence in the enemy nation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">And for political leaders and high-tier pvpers, this makes sense. But is Joe_Schmo37 really going to make a huge difference in a war?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I'm not saying to simply free them, no, I'm proposing a solution that benefits both the pearler and the pearlee- Slavery.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">A pearled player has nothing, and is nothing. He has nothing to do, and has no worth.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>That is, until slavery.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Slavery gives the pearled man purpose.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It gives him meaning, it allows him to contribute.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The Romans conquered their enemies and sent them as slaves to their people, and thus their people lived the greatest lives of their time. Slavery makes the common toils of life easier, and benefits all, whether they be common citizen or large corporation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Large mining project? One or two slaves with pickaxes makes that a good bit easier.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>More farmwork than you can handle? Get a helping hand.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Can't build for the life of you? Buy an enslaved builder to do it for you!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Imagine, you're a proud builder of a nation, constructing great monuments in it's name, when suddenly you just become nothing more than another wanderer in the end. But then, in the corner of your eye, you see it - Slavery! The shining hope that will let</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">you once more create wondrous builds and impact the communities around you. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I think it is clear to all at this point that slavery is a better alternative for all sides than to simply permapearl players and throw them in a chest for nothing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">So how, then, can big nations justify locking up these minor players forever? How can they justify not sharing their spoils of war, pearled players, with the people? How can they deny a viable source of labor to their citizenry?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">I ask you, nations of the world, how can you deny the will of the people?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>How can you deny slavery, the fuel which will power the machines of progress and prosperity?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Laborers of the world, Unify yourselves and protest!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>No more will you toil for hours, denied the services of slaves!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Merchants, rise up!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Call upon your leaders to open the doors to a new economic era, one of limitless luxury!</div></div>
