<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  After a long boat ride and an even longer ride south on the Great Overland Rail, I arrived at the railhead in a city called Falstadt.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  It is there, inside a large mead hall just</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">beyond the rails, that I came upon a war museum dedicated to the conflict known as The Somber War.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Plaques adorned the walls, describing the history of the conflict and the parties who were involved. Lexington and Anguish on one side,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Hjaltland, Mir, and The Commonwealth on the other.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  In addition to these plaques, cases displaying artifacts of the war are found: armor (missing), banners, rubble from Lexington, and other remnants of the fierce melee that took place</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">over the course of those bloody days.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Most affecting, however, is the wall of testimonials taken from both soldiers and bystanders who witnessed the carnage. Terse, cutting commentary that strikes at the heart of this harrowing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">struggle.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Boring, stupid, gay" recounts one individual, and "Nox sux cox" exclaims another.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  These statements are clear evidence of the terrible destructiveness wrought upon all those</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">involved in the days of horror, days in which the lives of entire nations hung in the balance.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  As I browsed the halls of the memorial, I wondered where the residents of Falstadt had gone. The streets were eerily  quiet, silent like the graves</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of the fallen soldiers memorialized in that hallowed place. A Christmas tree near the rail terminus suggested that the town had perhaps been abandoned in late 2017, but the only certainty was my lack of certainty.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  But as we know, time</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">moves slowly in our world, and perhaps the residents were simply out tending to their potato farms, or toting about a metric shit-ton of cobble that when placed, occupies hundreds of square meters of space, but then miraculously condenses when</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">mined and placed in inventory.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Perhaps they were off memeing in comms, or watching anime in their dirty boxers while mother prepared a steaming plate of tendies. It was all so unclear, but I found solace in the fact that as I exited</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the memorial, the city's torches still burned, the black smoke rising to mingle with the clouds.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  A sign of habitation.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  A sign of life.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I continued along the main avenue which led between Germanic styled homes, seemingly alone until</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">at last a voice called out. The voice of Melonrobot, unknown to me at the time, put my restless mind at ease. A local Hjaltlander, he greeted me and offered his assistance. He explained that his people are Techno Vikings and voracious botters, ruled over</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">by the mighty Jarl Frensin from his seat of power high in the spruce-covered hills.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Melonrobot explained that the nation of Hjaltland prides itself on the bulging sword arms of their warriors and their great proficiency at AFK botting, which initially</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">seemed contradictory in nature, but upon further discussion came to make much sense.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I came to understand that the city of Falstadt is mostly decorative these days, which helped explain the emptiness I described earlier,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and that the nation of Hjaltland is actually a very large nation in relation to others in this world.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Of particular interest to me, though, was the information that the largest vault in the world lay just south of where we spoke. Within its walls</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">were held the fallen warriors of Lexington's once powerful army, now branded war criminals after their defeat in The Somber War. To know these soldiers still existed in our world, though in a state of purgatory, sent chills down my spine.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">  I had come to believe that the dark days of total war were behind us, but this realization forced me to accept that the ghosts of struggles past still haunted our world, and should they ever be freed...<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Well, we won't venture down that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">path today.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  In any case, something in Melonrobot's words stirred my spirit, and I had to see the vault with my own eyes.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  To this point in my journey the only evidence of Hjaltland's war-like</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">nature had been the memorial constructed by locals, biased in their favor without a doubt. But as I made my way south I found further evidence of the many conflicts their brave populace had endured.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  There, off to the side of the road, was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">a massive crater, turned into a park to commemorate the war between Hjaltland and the nation of Nipplerock. In places the road had been torn asunder, blasted by the bombs of their enemies, the shattered stone lying in sharp contrast to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">tranquil sea beyond.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  And then I came upon the first signs of the vault: a string of posts stretching as far as the eye can see, each post bearing an ominous message to any who would come upon them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Private Property, trespassers will be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">violated. Turn back they warned. Beyond the posts rabid wolves patrolled the forest, and a great fear welled in my belly.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Good sense warned me to turn back. My life was too steep a price to pay to satisfy my curiosity. But good sense was overruled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">that day. My duty as a journalist and explorer prevailed, and so I ducked beneath the rusted concertina wire and pressed forward into the foreboding wood line.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  My curiosity would soon pay off.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">  Twigs snapped beneath my feet. Down a shallow gulch I went, up a scrubby rise, and then there before me the great black walls of obsidian shot skyward like the Great Wall of China, but greater, and not in China.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  It was the vault.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">  Neither the study of Milton's hellscapes, nor Dante's dark descent into the frigid underworld could have prepared me for the scale and grandeur of that deific structure. I call it a structure, but that word falls short. It was a citadel, a fortress of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">legendary proportions, unlike any the world had ever seen before. It scraped the roof of the world, so tall that its parapets were obscured by wisps of cloud and atmospheric haze.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  If dragons still roamed our skies,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">they'd be perched upon the heights of the vault, casting greedy eyes and great swaths of flame onto the world below. That is the sort of vibe one felt in the presence of this obsidian Goliath.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  As I thought these thoughts, somewhere</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">in the distance a wolf cried out, an eagle screeched high overhead, and then a voice echoed out to me from the void, "what is your business here, stranger?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  My blood chilled, and I feared that the great wall would close in around me and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">swallow me up into its depths. But I steeled my nerves. My intentions were pure, and so I replied that I was merely a traveler and documentarian, and I was there to record the might of Hjaltland for the ages.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  This seemed to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">appease the watchful apparition, whose tone quickly shifted from that of a questioning guardian to a cordial host.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Brief introductions followed, during which I learned that his name was Altvault. He told me the story of the vault, how his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">people had never intended to build such a structure for fear of its awful power, but how ultimately, it was a rival faction hell-bent on acquiring weapons of mass shittery that forced their hand.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  He told me of Animal Farm, a group of warriors</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">from distant shores that came into our world with the shitterest of intent, and described in gory detail the first war between Hjaltland and the foreign invaders, who were then led by an evil dark memelord named King Wyatt.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The fighting was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">brutal, merciless, a clickfest unlike any that had come before, but in the end Hjaltland prevailed, chasing the foreigners from the southern continent and securing an unsteady armistice.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  But the ceasefire was shortlived, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">soon the survivors of Animal Farm regrouped as the nation of Lexington. Hostilities flaired once again, and the armies of King Wyatt and his general darthkid took to the field of battle.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Swords clashed, mice clattered in dark</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">lonely basements, and hardly a soul went without being clicked repeatedly by their rivals. But in the end, Lexington was defeated once again.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The fallen were entombed within the impenetrable walls rising before me, and it is there that the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">souls of Lexington's warriors cry out to this very day, their prayers reaching skyward like the wailing of banshees, praying for the day a herculean force emerges from the ethernet to free them from their purgatory.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  With final farewells,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Altvault and I parted ways, he to return to his eternal vigil over the great citadel, and I to continue my march along the long, unknown road ahead of me.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  As I headed back toward Falstadt, a large, burly man riding a powerful steed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">bore down upon me. The horse reared, neighing wildly as froth splashed from its horse mouth. On its back was Jarl Frensin.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The Jarl was curious, enquiring as to my origin and business there in his vast territory. All very welcomingly,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of course, and seeing as his curiosity matched my own, we retired from the road to converse.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  In a nearby inn a beautiful Nordic wench with big, bouncy hair poured us flagons of ale, and the subject of the vault and its inhabitants once</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">again arose. The Jarl stated that never in the history of the world had a greater collection of shitters been gathered together in one spot, than the group then held in his awesome vault.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I staggered for words, and the only</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">reply I could muster was one word. "Neat."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "I'm not even exxagerating," he continued. We heartily chugged our frosty brews, which we drank from hollowed ram's horns to wash down the tasty house pork chops.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">  We told many tales. We laughed, we cried, we cajoled and we jokerooskied. But our cheeks soon grew sore from tales the likes of which will never be matched again, and the Jarl excused himself to attend to matters of state. I saw myself out, wishing that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the burgundy haired wench with the huge, jiggling locks of hair was accompanying me, but alas, I had other matters to attend to.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Such is my life.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  And so back into the darkness I strode, back onto the endless road of discovery</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and adventure, with a full belly and warm ruminations swirling about my mind. I was happy.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  And so concluded my travels in Hjaltland.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The Free City of Pacem<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
