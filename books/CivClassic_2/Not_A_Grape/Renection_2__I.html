Renection had many friends, including Mr. Brown, aka Franklin, Mr. Blue, aka Michael de Santana, Mr. White, aka Trevor McWhitetrash, and Mr. Yellow, aka Dumbledore, aka Zilean. Did Zilean die in the story before this?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 27</a><div class="page-content">I don’t remember, so he's alive now. So last time we left our heroes they were traveling through time with Karathustra then Malphite showed up and left us on a cliff hanger. Well, they got out of that business and now Renection and his friends are planning a bank heist.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 27</a><div class="page-content">They had come up with the ultimate plan because this would be the greatest heist of all time. The plan was decided was settled after much deliberation. They would walk into the bank on Monday morning and pass a check to the cashier.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 27</a><div class="page-content">The cashier would then hand them $1000 dollars, the amount specified on the check. They would then quickly run to the getaway vehicle running outside being manned by Mr. Brown.  Several days later, they successfully completed their heist and left the country</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 27</a><div class="page-content">at least a thousand dollars richer.  

The next day, in their Maycomb County jail cell safe house they split up their haul. It was only then that they realized that Mr. Orange was shot. None of them had medical training, so they panicked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Renektoon saw a show on Discovery once that had good information for emergency scenarios like this. He got down on his hands and knees and started furiously sucking the venom out of Mr. Orange’s wound. Mr. Orange screamed out in both pain and pleasure,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 27</a><div class="page-content">but before he was fully cured of his disease, Mr. Yellow blew him up. “One less person to split the money with,” said Mr. Yellow. Everyone agreed that Mr. Yellow was being an asshole, so someone suggested spending the money on a funeral instead. Renection was caught</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 27</a><div class="page-content">between agreeing with his friends or his former lover. He instead decided to take all the money for himself and invest in the latest fashion trend: Croc shoes/sandals/whatever the hell they are. He thought it was fitting considering</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 27</a><div class="page-content">his being a space crocodile. There was only one problem, the Crocs didn’t fit his oddly shaped crocodile feet. Oh, no!
