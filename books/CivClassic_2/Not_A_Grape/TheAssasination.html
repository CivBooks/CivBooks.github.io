<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 11</a><div class="page-content">I entered the throne room with cold blood.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">I had known from my previous investigations that the wool right behind the throne was only iron reinforced. My plan was to abuse this mistake.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content">I grabbed my efficiency pick and started hacking the wool away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content">If I wanted to enter the throne area, I had to break two pieces of wool. 

Maybe I could reach the king with my sword without entering the area? That would save the hassle of breaking an iron reinforced wool block.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">As soon as I broke the wool block on top, I started hitting the one in the bottom. I had only hit it a few times when the King noticed me. He started walking towards me. He had a "WTF ARE YOU DOING PLEB" espression in his ugly little face.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">With swift movements, he jumped out of the throne area using the 1 block gap I had made earlier. The King was only a few centimeters away from me at that moment. From his panicked steps and wing moves I figured he was going to attempt to call the guards.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 11</a><div class="page-content">I could not let that happen.

It was time.

I grabbed my sword. It took me only one hit to deal with the King. 

And just like that, I killed the King, on 
12th of April, 2013.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 11</a><div class="page-content">I was holding the corpse of His Majesty with an evil smirk on my face.

Oh how puny, how miserable he looked now...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 11</a><div class="page-content">I quickly put a decoy chicken in the place of the King using a spawn egg, then replaced the wool block I had removed. After that I proceeded to steal all the heir eggs and put plebian chicken eggs in their places.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Right now, the crime scene looks perfectly ordinary.

But they have snitches which they check regularly. They will know soon.

I don't have much time left.</div></div>
