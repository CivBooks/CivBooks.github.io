<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 6</a><div class="page-content">Jewberry's struggle against persecution.

The trials and tribulations of Jewberry are many, but none have been more vile than the discrimination he has suffered under the tyranny of strPlatinum in the realm of Southshire.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 6</a><div class="page-content">Jewberry walked into Southshire wide eyed and full of awe. Little did he know that the racists in the government of Southshire were already plotting ways of exploiting this innocent, pure brown man.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 6</a><div class="page-content">When Jewberry first entered Southshire, he was tasked with renovation. He was told to remove torches and glass panes in select areas and in return would be granted diamonds. Many days were spent with this hard worker slaving away under inhumane conditions in service of Southshire.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 6</a><div class="page-content">However, the xenophobic strPlatinum REFUSED to pay him. After blood, sweat, and tears were shed in service of his new home, his own leaders exploited his superior hispanic work ethic and refused to provide ample compensation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 6</a><div class="page-content">In response to his dystopian treatment at the hands of the racist government, Jewberry stated "People in power always keep the darker man silent."
For DARING to stand up for himself and spread the message of his exploitation, he was BANISHED from his new home.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 6</a><div class="page-content">Jewberry now lives in a hovel, outside of civilization in depression and poverty. This book hopes to spread social awareness of the systemic racism within Southshire and to seek justice for the sweet, innocent Jewberry Quiche.</div></div>
