Created by a former senator (Imperial Truidence) of 2019 davydbond, this journal is about my journey when I was lost. I would love to say that it was completely accidental, but in some part it was my problem</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Never get lost in the wild, if you need help then just ask someone. Or have fun.

<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 39</a><div class="page-content">To start my Story, I was in the city of Mountain September, a very bautiful city with many places to travel. But there was one problem, their rail station was kind of confusing for me so I did not get back to my city. Instead, I travaled to Pripyat.
And this is where my journey beigns.</div></div>

          Day 1

===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 39</a><div class="page-content">It is the start of my journey back to the great Imperial Truidence. I was lost and confused where the roads are taking me. It seemed as if I could not find the right way to get home using the rail station. The only way I thought will be fast is by walking and swimming on my boat</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 39</a><div class="page-content">But before this, I found myself in Pripyat, a city that was not taken by any nation as of December 2020. I then decided to take a road to Constantinople But also could not find a way home from there.
This was the first day, I was stranded but not scared for my life becuase this is a new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 39</a><div class="page-content">world and nothing could happen to me. I knew that The Infinity War is over, and most countries are at peace right now and trying to re build a healthy society. End of day 1.</div></div>

          Day 2

===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 39</a><div class="page-content">All of the cities were dead, I could not find anything useful withing them, so I took another road to another pretty big and dead city, Entrana (From the dead country Adina). When I arrived, It seemed nice and warm but once again– no souls were found there.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I took yet another road to New Cascadia (from the country Monterrey). As all other cities, it was dead and destroyed in some places, but turns out I found that they were stacked with terracotta, which was interesting since the whole city was built on wood and stones.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I saw how one war can change cities and countries, it was definitely devastating times that had heroes and losers at the end.
End of day 2.</div></div>

===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I decided that walking and swimming on my boat will be faster. I swam and found an entrance to Rekaland that was formerly Riverland. A beautiful city, yet it was another dead place.I swam a little north and found a lot of sugar cane growing, and there…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 39</a><div class="page-content">I found a friend, it was turtle in a boat. I knew that this is the only creature that I could talk to, so I changed boats and swam to my country with my friend. He was a good one becuase he never requested food and water, I liked him from the start.
End of day 3.</div></div>

          Day 4

===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 39</a><div class="page-content">As I swam, I found myself near dead country of Caledonia. Once a prosperous and great country with a  city of Adina that was strong and mighty… yet it was dead just like other cities and countries. Me and my friend, by the name Chad decided to take a river that was in unclaimed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 39</a><div class="page-content">lands to the south west of Pripyat. The road was long and time consuming, but I had my buddy with me who would always talk to me in a tortoise language. I couldn't understand what he wanted, waybe he was also looking for a friend.
End of day 4.</div></div>

===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Who knew that this river will be a canyon. This was definitely a place for some nice views that were taking my breath away. The most interesting is that it was not touched… almost. I would love to claim those lands and turn into a great city of Bezantine,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 39</a><div class="page-content">honoring our great fallen leader and supreme commander Bez. As I left the canyon and swam more to the west, I found myself in a village that was made out of sand, definitely a new view. I was shocked by seeing this as I am the one who always lived in riches and mansions in the capital</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 39</a><div class="page-content">This shocked me, but also gave new inspiration to the city projects that I want to reqeest.

===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 39</a><div class="page-content">It took me one day to reach the next stop, it was the city of Buru’kendi on the mushroom island, which is also very unusual for my eyes. From there, I knew that the destroyed kingdom of Varkonia should be near, and my rescue station should be there.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 39</a><div class="page-content">But to my unfortune, I re read an old map of Political Map 2020 and it turned out that Varkonia did not have any stations. So, for the rest of my journey, I will be swimming in my boat with my only companion Chad.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 39</a><div class="page-content">As of my food, I was running low on it and thought that the time to eat my only companion has come. But this island full of mushroom, and cows of a weird nature that give mushroom soup instead of milk, have saved me and my companion. I had more than enough of water due to rains that were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 39</a><div class="page-content">always pouring in this area. It was like the sky was crying after the great war ended, it was washing off all the blood that was shed on this earth.
End of day 6.</div></div>

Something very similar to what bees are building, it was yellow too, so this was a nice find for myself. Looking at differnt cultures I have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 39</a><div class="page-content">realized something that was very important for me. It is the importance of keeping peace among nations. And importance of protecting one another from any incoming attack from the enemy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 39</a><div class="page-content">As always, I find it interesting how Chad was able live through this whole journey and make me a company when I really needed that.

===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 39</a><div class="page-content">And there I saw, a great pine forest that was so close to my heart that I knew, it was almost the end of my journey. I felt that the fresh air was hitting my face and there I saw, a great vertical boat of the Imperial Truidence. I am home.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 39</a><div class="page-content">My heart was pounding fast as I was coming closer and closer to the dock. My heart was content and free from any stressors because I was under the great holiness and protection of our sovereign king Bez and Spatula.
End of day 8,</div></div>
