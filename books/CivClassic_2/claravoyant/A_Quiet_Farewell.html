<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The plan changed from going one by one to leaving as one group beside High Mother Moomabelle. However,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We gathered upon the shore of Belle Harbour, our former home, it was a sad sight to behold. We said our goodbyes and headed through the city.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 40</a><div class="page-content">It was ironic that we would use their own railways, the connections they had made themselves to make our exit.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We moved through Palgrave and onto Anwynn, it was tense, fear permeated the air. The fear of the officials catching us, the fear of us being</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 40</a><div class="page-content">collared. It was not a dangerous journey through friend or foe, but to us, it was terror.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I did feel remorse for our actions, their harmony might have been brought back in tune but after what we resorted to, I doubt they would have let us.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Mother Moomabelle sat proudly at the back of her herd, watching over us as we rode the rails. But then came a set back, we lost our way. We five of the Bell that left that night found ourselves in a rotunda, with no direction to follow and the knowledge</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 40</a><div class="page-content">that we could be pursued at any moment. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Sister Tiffany tried her luck with the rails whilst Sister Margo, Knight of the 13th Toll waited, ready for combat. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I merely stayed put and chronicled what was happening</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Finally using the old maps of the tunnels that run beneath our land, Sister Tiffany found just what we needed. A way forward, a path, we headed west.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Once more though disaster struck. The rails were at fault, sending Mother Moomabelle back, her coming free from her cart. Whilat not a fighter I was loyal to our cause.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I bailed out and and ran to her aid, standing ready with my shield raised just</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Together we helped Mother Moomabelle back into her cart, and set off once more with myself at the rear this time.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 40</a><div class="page-content">It was then we heard the cries of Sister Margo from ahead, "Creeper on the tracks". <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This could set us back awfully, if it blew it could bring down the cieling or uproot the tracks, or even cause our death. It was almost enough to distract us from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 40</a><div class="page-content">the new threat. There were snitches along this track, we were being watched.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was from here we headed west, towards the Holy Jade Empire. With only two stops betweeb us and our new home, we could relax a bit more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 40</a><div class="page-content">This gave us time to reflect, to feel the weight of the shadow over us. News had hit us of what was happening in Palgrave, word had travelled quickly.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We had intended to make a quiet goodbye. What we did was wrong, we went too far,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 40</a><div class="page-content">based off of rumours of evil and cruelty, so we reacted with evil and cruelty.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The bell tolls a sorrowful tune this night indeed. I wonder how things would have gone without the violence, or the traps, or the theft. Or even if we had just brought up our</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 40</a><div class="page-content">concerns with the leaders themselves. I can't condone the actions of the 13th toll, I regret not stepping in to stop them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This is our darkest act in history, it goes against everything we stand for and as such it is noted, so that we do not forget.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 40</a><div class="page-content">We can not forget, we will never resort to these actions again, we have better. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Our new home was to be a place to put things behind us and improve, to ring new, a life worthy of the bell and what it teaches.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 4<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 40</a><div class="page-content">They had us, they knew our movements and sent an envoy. But they were not mad, they were not filled with hate, they were hurt and confused.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The talks were peaceful though fraught with emotion, but in the end an agreement was made.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Sister Margo would return the stolen goods, taking in tow with her Sister Tiffany as an aide.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So the long journey was made once more by our two sisters. Back to Palgrave, the nation we had hurt. It was up in the air whether it was a trap, but I like to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 40</a><div class="page-content">believe their intentions were not ill, even if they were, had we not wrought it upon ourselves.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But on the return they were met with civility, it seems our idea of what Palgrave was and what it was false doctrine spread merely through hearsay.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 40</a><div class="page-content">This only cemented our guilt. We would still start a new life elsewhere, with a chance to be better.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But at least we knew Palgrave were not evil, this only meant that the attrocities were in our hands. Maybe one day we would return, peaceful and</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Sister Val was gathering resources for us to begin to build with whilst I would finish this, our most mournful song.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We would exist peacefully, no more Knights of the 13th toll, no repeats of that night. We have to be better than this.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
