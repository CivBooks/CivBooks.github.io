<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>my brother (Undead_H0rr0r) decided to make a small camp with a couple of buildings.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After wandering around aimlessly for a while, I came across a large town known as Mt. Augusta. There had been some murder and pearling there, but it wasn't too bad.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 30</a><div class="page-content">I asked around about joining a town, when I meet a guy named Dabobscotts. He says that I seem like a legit player, and we go to his old town, leaving Augusta, and heading for the abandoned town of Xanadu. That's when I told my friends about CivCraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Around 5 of them joined Xanadu. We bacame a nice, peaceful, growing town. But then, unexpectedly, while my friend, Ollyg_99, and I are walking around the town, minding our own business, these two guys come up and say "we're friendly."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content">There were HCF, and we knew they were. Olly and I scouted around our town, looking for them. They were in the town centre, and thought I was alone. They were wrong. I was only in iron armour, while one of them was in full diamond (the other iron).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 30</a><div class="page-content">I charged at one. I had a few pots at my disposal and managed to kill the guy in iron while Olly was fending off the guy in diamond. The guy in diamond ran for his life, we gave chase. He managed to log, but we stayed around for a little while.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 30</a><div class="page-content">He came back on, and we owned him, taking all his gear. That's when we knew we had to leave. We stayed for a little while longer, and in that time two of my other friends managed to get into some trouble, stealing stuff out of the town hall's chests.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 30</a><div class="page-content">They weren't pearled or killed, but Dabobscotts made sure he was repayed.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>My two friends and I started a little underground town. But peace yet again was short lived.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>and raid us.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After I left Buenos Aires with most of my valuables, I was leary of using the nether, because of HCF and random killings and pearlings, so I set off overland.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>a lot of trading was going on there. I walked all the way from Buenos Aires to Nine, not using the the Nether, and I had many encounters.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I lay off it, and continue to Nine.</div></div>
