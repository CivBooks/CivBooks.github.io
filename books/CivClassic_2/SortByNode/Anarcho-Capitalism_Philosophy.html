Ancaps see free-market capitalism as the basis for a free and prosperous society.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Ancaps argue that the state is an initiation of force because it can be used against those who have not stolen private property, committed criminal fraud. Many also view monopolies as structures that are inclined to becoming corrupt</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 37</a><div class="page-content">and inefficient over the course of time. Though Ancaps are known for asserting a right to private (individualized or joint non-public) property, some agree that non-state public or community property can also exist in a Anarcho- Capitalist society.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Civcraft originally came into existence as Ancap-Minecraft, without any particular goal in mind. The server's open and politically free climate quickly attracted</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 37</a><div class="page-content">many other persuasions aside from the original Ancap inhabitants. The sudden arrival of several different ideological groups pushed the server's level of civilization and related development forward at a pace that was fascinating.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 37</a><div class="page-content">The level of cooperation that this civilization fostered rapidly brought the server to a Utopian level of server and social development, food was plentiful, building materials were in abundance, and scarcity was unheard of.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 37</a><div class="page-content">As one can imagine, this state of affairs was not without its own set problems; the economy was stagnant, as Capitalism in a scarcity free environment hasn't been fully worked out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 37</a><div class="page-content">The land became dull and the community was faced with the prospect of becoming stale. To deal with this, Ancap-Minecraft became Civcraft; a grand experiment of communities, politics, discussion, and debate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Civcraft was from the beginning a different place than Ancap-Minecraft, it was to become more open place and changes were made to make the political dynamics and their ramifications all the more persistent.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Ancap philosophy in Civcraft centers around respect for private property and non-coercion; from these two central rules, many Ancap policies flow. Respect for private property means that what people create and build and own is to be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 37</a><div class="page-content">respected and unmolested, and their original intent should be respected. For example: if someone built a farm that was dependent upon the sunlight, then building a giant pixel art wall after the farm was established that blocked out the sun</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 37</a><div class="page-content">would infringe upon the farm's integrity and it's intent. Non-coercion means that transfer of property or services should be voluntary and free from threats of  force, for example: if a person wanted property and used force to seize</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 37</a><div class="page-content">the property, Ancaps would hold that the property was not acquired legally and the possession was illegitimate. Ancaps generally believe that monopolies are structurally inclined to drift towards an authoritarian state and inefficient behavior over time.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Competition produces new developments whereas Monopolies perpetuate the established order and often result in the usage of force towards threats to the system of the established order.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Monopolies are often inclined toward inefficiency due to their lack of competition, over time without sufficient challenge such a Monopoly becomes tolerant of self-harming behavior that is not conducive to the original goals of the institution.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 37</a><div class="page-content">For example, a police force that has a monopoly on the use of force often is progressively corrupt over time. Ancaps in Civcraft want property to be respected, and people to be free from coercion in their dealing with one another.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Those two tenants are the pillars of Ancap philosophy concerning it's application in Civcraft.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Central to Anarcho-Capitalism are the concept of self-ownership and the concept of original application. Everyone is the proper owner of his own physical body as well as of all places</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 37</a><div class="page-content">In particular, once a place or good has been appropriated first by someone through the infusing one's labor upon it which is to say that the good can only then be appropriated through voluntary means.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the Contractual Society.  Ancap Philosophy envisions a society based purely on voluntary action,</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 37</a><div class="page-content">The totally voluntary nature of this social order is arguably more free than any other- as any and all obligations are made through voluntarily contract and agreement, whereas the system of taxation by the state is not.</div></div>
