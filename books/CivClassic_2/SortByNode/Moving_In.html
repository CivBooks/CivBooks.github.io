<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I had been awake so long the sun was coming up. I don't remember the last time I actually slept, so this was nothing new. I'd found my way to the top of a small hill, overlooking the recessed valley below.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The tree I was under had an apple that had fallen, so I gobbled it up as the days first rays of sunlight started to warm my skin. I finished off the apple and looked down into the small valley below me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 25</a><div class="page-content">That's when I first saw him. Average looking guy, blue jeans and a light bluish-green t-shirt, standing idly in the bottom of the bowl-like depression between my hill and another directly west.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He seemed confused, wandering in small circles. It was probably about 30 seconds before he started punching the dirt. Amused, and a bit confused myself, I watched as he eventually punched out a deep enough hole to climb down into, out of view.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 25</a><div class="page-content">It was then that Terry came over, his hair damp from a dip in a nearby river.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What's he doing?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>he asked.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Beats me,"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I responded.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 25</a><div class="page-content">We stood there, milling about at the top of the hill, waiting for the stranger to emerge from his hole. It only took another couple of minutes before we saw him pull himself out of<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the ground.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He stood next to his handiwork and seemed pleased with himself.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Think he's gonna live down there or something?", Terry inquired.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I dunno. Go ask him if you're so interested," I scoffed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Terry was a borderline douche, and I was quickly getting tired of his shit. He would keep me up all night, yapping it up with his other friends. Also, he once almost "accidentally" shoved me off a cliff on a beach trip.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I still hadn't let that go completely.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What if he's a psycho killer?" Terry queried.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Then you'll be doing the world a favor by going over and introducing yourself," I quipped.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The frown Terry<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>put on didn't get an ounce of guilt out<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>of me.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The stranger was<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>now piling the dirt he'd dug into a<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>rough adobe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Probably only a few feet wide and even fewer feet tall, his head nearly touched the doorway as he moved in and out, carrying on with whatever mad project this all was. I decided to hang around and watch.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Terry had already started meandering over towards the forest, where he and his buddies usually congregated. That was fine with me. Terry was a blabbermouth and I was more interested in the newcomer anyway.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I watched him for hours, scurrying around the valley, chopping down trees, making a door for<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>his small home.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content">At one point he came out of his meager hovel with a axe. I had no idea where that came from, but with it, he was cutting through the trees in the valley like a madman, his hands a blur as he felled tree after tree.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">As the sun started to go down, I realized I was getting pretty hungry. Remembering some sugar cane I saw over near the beach, I started away from the valley.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I'd probably made it about 100 yards when I heard footsteps behind me. I wasn't too worried, since no one usually bothered me (except for Terry's douche friends), so I didn't even turn around. That's when I felt<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the first punch.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I was dazed. I didn't know what to do. I cried out and spun around, and there stood the stranger I'd been watching all day.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What the hell, man?!" I shouted, only half coherent from the blow he'd delivered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 25</a><div class="page-content">His silence was accompanied by another punch. This one landed right on my nose, snatching the breath from my lungs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I panicked. I started running. I told myself to zig zag. Try to lose him. Pounding through the forest, desperate to escape, I could hear the soft lapping of the waves on the beach. If I could make it there, I could lose him, I thought.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 25</a><div class="page-content">That's when another crushing blow landed on my hip. He was still behind me, still punching. I tried to beg, tried to plead. I didn't know this guy. I didn't mean to upset him by casually observing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I told him I'd make it up to him, frantically trying to say anything to end the pummeling, but he would not yield. He meant to see me dead.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I collapsed to the ground, exhausted and in unimaginable pain.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I looked into the stranger's eyes as he prepared his final strike, pleading with all my heart, "Please! I'm sorry! Please, no! Whatever I did, I'm sorry! PLEASE!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The stranger raised his fist one final time, looking down at my shattered body, before licking his lips and whispering through a wicked grin.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"Mmmm. Porkchops,"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>he said<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>...and<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> then everything went black.</div></div>
