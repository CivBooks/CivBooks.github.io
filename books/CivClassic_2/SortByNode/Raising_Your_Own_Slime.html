<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtl">Getting your slime <span class="fmt0"></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The first step of owning a pet slime is acquiring your pet slime. Depending on the rules of your world, this may be more or less difficult.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 40</a><div class="page-content">In some worlds, slime eggs are sold over the countertop and the problem will be money, rather than hunting the slimes down.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 40</a><div class="page-content">In this case, I highly recommend asking at redstone shops that carry pistons, as they are likely willing to share where they get the cheapest slime for their pistons.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 40</a><div class="page-content">However, if such a service is not available to you, you're going to have to hunt the slimes down yourself.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Now, slimes can be found in either<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">a) Caves deep underground<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">b) Wet environments, like swamps</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 40</a><div class="page-content">While you will find greater amounts of slime in caves, I recommend above ground environments. They are safer and easier to locate the slimes in.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 40</a><div class="page-content">You'll want to look for slime eggs. If you are looking to get slimes for a zoo, adult slimes can be chased into cages. Since these were raised in the wild, they will be extra dangerous but entertaining for an audience.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Slime eggs are usually found on trees near the waterbed, or on trees standing directly in water.  Beware that the mother slimes (<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">slimes never have less than three parents<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">) will usually be nearby and quick to protect the eggs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 40</a><div class="page-content">You will need to kill or lure these slimes into water.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Slime eggs are very tenacious, they can be carried by hand for at least an hour before they dry out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 40</a><div class="page-content">If you need to transport them for longer, carry them in a bucket of water or slime, or a mixture of the two.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">When you get to a place where you can build a cage, put the eggs in shallow water and turn this page.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 40</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl">Chapter 2:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtl">Making a good cage<span class="fmt0"></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">A good cage for a slime emulates one of the natural habitats it has. The floor should be either moss, grass or solid material.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 40</a><div class="page-content">If you choose to make the floor out of moss or grass, make sure that the slime has an adequate source of water to bathe themselves in.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Note that slimes have a hard time navigating water, so you will need to provide a slab stepping stone to help them out of the water, and the pool shouldn't be more than 1 meter deep.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 40</a><div class="page-content">An alternate way is to drizzle water on the slime or let water drip through the ceiling.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">If you choose to make the floor of solid material, it should be completely solid with no cracks or edges in it, and preferably not very conductive of heat.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Solid stone works well for this purpose. If your floor has cracks in it, like cobblestone, your slime's health and size will degenerate as it loses slime down the cracks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 40</a><div class="page-content">You can use this method as a gentler alternative to chopping off parts of your slime, if you wish to reduce its size. Make sure the slime has plenty of water to help it recover health if so.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Slimes' eyes are relatively poor. They cannot perceive glass or ice, unless it's stained or colored.  Even if your slime is tame, it will make attempts at getting through clear materials.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 40</a><div class="page-content">If you decide to use these materials in your cage, make sure they are reinforced to a point that a grown slime slamming into them won't break them, as well as not having any cracks or edges in it like a solid floor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Slimes can see iron bars or fences just fine, however.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Lastly, the dimensions of your cage. It is HIGHLY recommended that you make the cage big enough to let the slime jump as high as they can.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Maintaining the health of a slime that can't fully jump is very difficult, and should only be attempted by experts. The slime should also have enough space to make at least one full horizontal jump across its cage.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 40</a><div class="page-content">The precise length of this varies on the size of your slime and its personality, so measure and rebuild as you go.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 40</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl">Chapter 3: Your <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtl">slime's childhood <span class="fmt0"></span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">When you have your cage ready to go, place the slime eggs in there and smother them with slime ooze collected from other slimes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 40</a><div class="page-content">If you do not have any of this, don't worry. The eggs will not hatch as long as you don't have the goop, so if they're near water and in a secured cage, you can journey to get the ooze you need with no worries.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Once you have them smothered, they may either hatch right away or continue incubating if they didn't finish as you built the cage.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">If they're still incubating, keep smothering the eggs in ooze daily and they should hatch shortly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Contrary to popular belief, the small slimes usually seen in habitats are NOT baby slimes. In fact, tiny and small slimes are more likely to have lived longer than larger ones.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Do not be scared when you see your pet slime for the first time - until slimes reach adulthood, they have no face or visible front side. They are completely blind and have a hard time remembering things, so make sure you are very careful with them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Slimes grow to size within 24 hours, and the childhood will usually last only a month with a good environment.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 40</a><div class="page-content">You should feed your slime mostly soft material - plants like cacti or regular human food work well for this. Just put the food in the enclosure and the slime will eat whenever it needs to.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 40</a><div class="page-content">A slime's childhood is the very best time to bond with it. Getting a lot of physical contact with the slime at this point will teach it that you aren't food, and it won't hurt a lot since baby slimes aren't very adept at predating.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 40</a><div class="page-content">However, since your slime can neither see, nor smell, nor remember very well, it'll be hard for them to recognize you once they reach adulthood.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 40</a><div class="page-content">A good method for helping your slime recognize you is to whistle the same short melody every time you bond with your slime as a baby. This tune will help them recognize you without getting too close once your slime is an adult.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 40</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl">Chapter 4:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtl">Raising your slime <span class="fmt0"></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Once your slime reaches adulthood, give yourself a pat on the back. Adult slimes are largely self-sufficient and will require little additional training.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Adult slimes are excellent, if not unusual, combat partners, as other monsters will not react with hostility until the slime has begun attacking. Slimes are the only overworld monster that have been successfully tamed so far.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Your adult slime should feed itself- either with the remains of your enemies or with various materials around.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Once they reach adulthood, slimes can eat pretty much everything, so make sure to teach your slimes what materials it SHOULDN'T eat, like what you built your house out of.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Like most creatures, your slime will eventually die of old age if nothing else. One day, your slime will simply dissolve itself into water after a period of increasing liquidity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 40</a><div class="page-content">It's a custom in some places to pour the resulting water into the birthplace of the slime, but it's not unheard of to throw the water away or use it in some other way if you want to.</div></div>
