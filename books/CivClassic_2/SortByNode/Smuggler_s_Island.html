<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 34</a><div class="page-content">It took a little over an hour for Harithoel to search the island from one end to the other. He turned back to S'Riizh who was where he left him, half buried in the sand to pack his broken bones. One of the crates of moon sugar was open.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"You're sampling the merchandise?" asked Harithoel angrily.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"It takes away the pain," said S'Riizh. "How far away are we?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"We didn't make it as far as the mainland," said Harithoel. "I can't see the coastline at all. But that's not all. I haven't found anything edible anywhere. Just weeds and a few scraggly trees."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"And no other survivors?" asked S'Riizh.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"No, it looks like we're the only ones. I guess, the nice way to look at it is that if we're rescued, we can divide the profits between two rather than between twelve."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"So we'll either be rich or dead," said S'Riizh. "That's a comfort."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">S'Riizh was too battered to be of much help, but Harithoel was able to construct a crude shelter, weaving the sand weeds.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 34</a><div class="page-content">As night fell on the small island, the two men discussed the smuggling operation and what went wrong. Their boat, laden with five crates of moon sugar, was supposed to meet another, the Sanchariot, off the coast of Hla Oad.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Who could have predicted the storm? Who could have predicted that everyone would drown, from the bold captain to the mysterious figure with ties to one of the royal Houses, everyone except for S'Riizh and Harithoel.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 34</a><div class="page-content">They decided that it was all the whim of Boethiah or one of the other daedra with cruel senses of humor.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Finding fresh water was their first goal, and it turned out to be a fruitless quest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Harithoel dug deeply, but there were no springs under the island, just sand<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">and rock.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 34</a><div class="page-content">S'Riizh felt panic seizing his soul, until he saw the small, quick, golden fish swimming at the edges of the island. He had read somewhere that fish not only were food, but there was always a little fresh water within them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 34</a><div class="page-content">If he could catch one, the two men could be saved. With his broken legs, he was a pathetic predator and he was soon reduced to hurling rocks at the alert and nimble little fish.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Harithoel watched S'Riizh's futile endeavor for a little while before getting to work. He used his small knife to whittle a point on a long, straight tree branch until he had fashioned a spear.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Again and again, he thrust the spear at the fish, but he had no more success than S'Riizh and his stones.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Have you never used a spear before?" asked S'Riizh.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"It's not my weapon of choice," said Harithoel, quietly, watching his prey and missing another with a splash and a curse. "Nchow!"<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">S'Riizh laughed: "Do you want a rock?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Harithoel ignored S'Riizh, murmuring.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"The trick as I've heard it is to anticipate where your target's going to go and aim your spear there, not where they are now. I just have to observe them a little longer."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"Why can't the little fechers swim in straight lines?"<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">After an hour of flailing about, Harithoel, by luck, managed to spear a fish. The men tore it apart and ate it raw.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 34</a><div class="page-content">As the days and weeks went by, Harithoel got better and better until he was able to strike quickly and with great accuracy. He could hit a fish by throwing the spear or by plunging at one at his feet.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">S'Riizh made fire, but being lame, he had to rely on Harithoel for all the food. It was nearly two months after washing ashore that the men saw a boat on the horizon. They set a large fire, and the crew saw them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 34</a><div class="page-content">As it approached, they saw that it was the Sanchariot, the very boat they were to have met on the night of the storm. The smugglers aboard would pay them good money for the moon sugar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Luckily, S'Riizh had used only a little bit of it, and they still had five nearly full crates. They were not only going to be saved, they were going to be rich, just as Harithoel had said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Harithoel excitedly started to help S'Riizh to his feet, but the man rose on his own.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"You can walk!" he said, laughing. "It's a miracle!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"S'Riizh is not too steady, though," said S'Riizh. "Would you gather up the crates?"<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Harithoel, overjoyed at rescue at long last, began picking up the crates and stacking them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"I wish you had told me that you could walk though, mate. I could have used your help spearing dinner all these months."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"S'Riizh watches though," said S'Riizh. "You'd be surprised how much you can learn just by watching. Don't forget the fifth crate over by the tree."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content">S'Riizh shuffled over to the shore and saw that the boat was only a few minutes from landing. "And S'Riizh listens."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"When you said that a fortune divided by two was more profitable than a fortune divided by twelve, S'Riizh listened to that too." S'Riizh shuffled back to the crate by the tree.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"And it occurred to S'Riizh that a fortune divided by one was even better." S'Riizh pulled the spear out of Harithoel's skull.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 34</a><div class="page-content">The trajectory had been perfect: it had fallen down from the branches as soon as the crate was removed, just as he had planned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 34</a><div class="page-content">"Like you said, the trick is to anticipate where your target's going to go and aim your spear there." S'Riizh pushed the crate to the shore and waved the boat in.</div></div>
