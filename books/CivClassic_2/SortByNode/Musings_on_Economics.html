<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 29</a><div class="page-content">On Planet Earth, one feature is common to almost all human interaction - trade. It may be accomplished by many different mechanisms, ranging from barter to gifting and, most common in capitalist economies, trading currency for goods and services.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Civcraft's stated aim to simulate an alternative world within Minecraft has allowed for all manner of emergent developments, mainly states and legal codes,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 29</a><div class="page-content">but one point of particular interest is the de facto server currency which has emerged. It differs dramatically from the material historically used in the real world, gold.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Civcraft is, as always, bound by Minecraft, and as a result diamonds and iron have untold numbers of uses. Gold, in the real world, is not an ideal substance with which to create tools and armour, or to reinforce a structure.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Diamonds and iron emerged as the currency on Civcraft early in the server's history, possibly because of their perceived value.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Where in the real world gold was viewed as a status symbol, a full suit of diamond armour and tools fulfil the same function a well-made flint axe did in the neolithic era for the early specimens of humanity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 29</a><div class="page-content">The markets have grown around these emergent currencies globally, and exchange rates are often similar or even identical on opposite sides of the map. It is here that a limitation of Minecraft once again hampers Civcraft's attempts at simulation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 29</a><div class="page-content">The existence of an identical currency available in all parts of the map makes global trade incredibly easy, essentially shortcutting thousands of years of history and to an extent homogenising the states on Civcraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Diamonds are the symbol of wealth not only because of their use as currency but also due to the role they play in enabling high-level pvp, creating vaults to house criminals and in the creation of the most efficient and durable tools.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Some attempts have been made to impose a fiat currency, such as Communa's use of gold in its internal market in 1.0 and Saraliana's minting of its own currency, but these have never really caught on - and why would they?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 29</a><div class="page-content">A currency exists on Civcraft that is easily moved, safely stored and used for everything from resource collection to security to construction.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 29</a><div class="page-content">It is no wonder, surely, that wherever you go in the world you will more than likely be able to buy whatever you need at the same or similar prices to what you would pay in your own town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Another example of emergent trade in Civcraft is the subbredit CivcraftExchange. Created at the beginning of the server, it fulfils an obvious function - to enable international trade.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 29</a><div class="page-content">And yet, unlike in the real world, most trading activity is between two individuals acting independently.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 29</a><div class="page-content">There are almost no examples of meaningful companies or corporations on Civcraft, mainly because their existence is unnecessary. There is no specialised labour in minecraft other than the creation of redstone machinery.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Anything can be created by anyone, providing they know the crafting recipe and/or have access to the correct factory. There is no taxation of profit or codes of law that would encourage or impede the creation of companies.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 29</a><div class="page-content">CivcraftExchange is interesting in that although the de facto server currency is accepted there, and is commonly used, it also allows for the use of barter in trade.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 29</a><div class="page-content">There was some thought before 2.0 was brought online in attempting to diversify the areas in which resources could be found, theunderlying hope being that it would lead to noticeable differences between areas of the map.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Once again, we were defeated by the limitations of Minecraft - all a city has to do is be built or have an outpost near the boundaries of several different biomes and they have access to every possible resource.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 29</a><div class="page-content">The ensuing paucity of a labour market in Civcraft is the direct result of the lack of specialisation I have referred to in an earlier paragraph - any individual can create anything, even if they have no prior knowledge of what they want to make.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 29</a><div class="page-content">As a result, we have no tradesmen, carpenters, stonemasons, glaziers, etc. Imagine a Civcraft where in order to craft items using wood, you had to train in carpentry, most probably under a master.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 29</a><div class="page-content">No one who had not done so could craft using wood. Suddenly we have both a labour market (<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">for trained carpenters<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">) and a specialised market for wooden items (<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">as not just anyone can create them.<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Perhaps a master carpenter's tools are more durable than those made by a journeyman, and so sell for orders of magnitude more than those created by a lowly apprentice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 29</a><div class="page-content">The same concept of being required to learn a trade or skill before it is possible to create something would revolutionise trade on Civcraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 29</a><div class="page-content">The list of things which would emerge is perhaps endless - brand loyalty, trade schools or colleges, local craftsmen leading to differences in prices and tool quality between areas, and so on.</div></div>
