<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">In the beginning there was only one thing, The Mother. She lived alone in the darkness for many years...<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One day she looked around her and saw nothing. She realized that she was very bored. She thought she could do with something new to look at.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">She then created the Aether.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But soon she grew tired of it, and she decided she wanted something a bit more beautiful. So she created the flowers, the trees, and the grass.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">She realised that it was too dark to really enjoy her creations. So she gave birth to a son. She gave him a gift,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>a glowing globe. She enjoyed watching the trees grow in the light of her son's presence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">She also loved watching the Queen of the Night. For some reason, the Queen of The Night preferred her light and decided to sleep whenever her son was near.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The lightbearer felt that the world was missing something.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The plants felt it too. For with each day that passed, they lost some of their color. After a while all the plants had lost their color and appeared dull as the dirt.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Mother was angry that color had vanished.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">She decided to create some new creatures. She created the skeletons, the creepers, and<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the zombies.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The lightbearer looked with disgust at his mother's latest creations.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">All they did was hunt each other. He thought that he could save the monsters from his mother's boredom by recreating the colors of the plants. He took a look at the last existing flowers and discovered the fact that a core element in them was water.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">So he created water in Aether.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>His mother was happy, but she enjoyed the fights far too much to care about the health of those that did the fighting.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The lightbearer decided that he would create his own world where he could protect the population from harm. He created the earth, and cured the skeletons and zombies. They became the first women and men of his new world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The cured creepers became the first pigs.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>His mom looked with joy on her son's new world, but she felt it was somehow too peaceful. So she created demonic wolves and queen spiders.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The lightbearer looked with horror at how his mom treated his kingdom. He tried to cure them, but he only managed to weaken the curse. Thus some of the wolves become passive-aggressive, and some of the spiders became weaker.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The lightbearer decided to create a world just for himself to relax in. He built it with fire, and called it the Nether. He created some minions who enjoyed living there: pigmen, ghasts and blaze.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">His mother decided to interfere. She taught mankind how to create nether portals. Mankind soon learned that ghasts and blaze weren't as peaceful as their creator.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">His mother was jealous so she created a world for herself and called it the End. She created endermen who would go on raiding tours. When the first army of them was defeated by mankind, she created their leaders, Elder endermen.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 16</a><div class="page-content">She then abandoned the Aether because she was tired of it. Then the lightbearer decided to split his time between the two worlds.  Whenever he wasn't present in a world, the monsters that his mother had created would thrive.</div></div>
