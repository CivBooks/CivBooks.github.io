On the fourth day of the raids, many new accounts, who were later discovered to be banned players using VPNs, began appearing to join the raider crew.

On the 12th of March 2021, a friendly situation in a large hole in Mount September turned serious as newfriends TheNeonNerd, NEBULANDD and AmandaCC continually
killed each other, egged on by AllenY</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 49</a><div class="page-content">and his philosophy of <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>K I L L</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>.
The continuous killing ceased to become all in good fun when, after AmandaCC pearled TheNeonNerd, releasing him immediately after, the latter killed eight baby slimes that AmandaCC had gathered after killing a big slime. AmandaCC then became</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 49</a><div class="page-content">and was set on pearling TheNeonNerd, and tracked him down.
After successfully finding and pearling him, AmandaCC stored the pearl in one of her personal chests and proposed a contract to Neon that would stipulate him not
coming close to her house herself under
the threat of a large</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 49</a><div class="page-content">fine in exchange for his freedom, however it was refused. Then, Nebula, a friend of Neon, broke into AmandaCC’s house and broke the chest in which Neon’s pearl was stored, freeing him immediately.
After this happened, almost simultaneously, AmandaCC requested a trial against Nebula</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 49</a><div class="page-content">for property rights infringement and Neon requested a trial against AmandaCC for unlawful pearling.
Nebula pleaded guilty in their case, however, neither side ceded in TheNeonNerd vs AmandaCC, and when it came time for the latter to prove her
innocence she wrote multiple paragraphs</div></div>

After this, both trials were freezed at the request of their respective plaintiffs, and shortly after, both cases were dropped, the trio having come to an out-of-court solution.</div></div>

Leader of the young Admiralty of Wesbury Orinnari publicly considered on the 16th of March 2021 creating an “Open Pursuit” treaty between Mount September and his country, saying
"the fundamental</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 49</a><div class="page-content">premise of the extradition treaty was that signatories would refrain from claiming jurisdiction over captured persons if the claim of jurisdiction is based solely on location”.
However, when it was pointed out that Orinnari could simply
go through MtS's simple extradition</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 49</a><div class="page-content">processs, the conversation quickly turned into an argument, as the leader of Wesbury thought it was wrong that he would have to “beg” to keep the pearl, saying “I need to explain and beg and justify me wanting to pearl them”, also stating it was unfair that other nations</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 49</a><div class="page-content">could impose themselves on crimes done to other nations simply because they possessed the pearl. The argument saw a back and forth of presenting similar arguments over and over again for a long time, as both sides refused to concede.
Orinnari later stated
"The Admiralty of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Wesbury has formally withdrawn from treaty negotiations with Mouth September since the Lord Admiral currently considers Mount September as an unreliable neighbour.”
The Lord Admiral of Wesbury then, on the 23rd, proposed another solution:
an embassy; but not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 49</a><div class="page-content">just any embassy, a “condominium” that would act as “a secure storage building where [Wesbury would] put captured persons until extradition is allowed”.
A location was proposed in the newly created embassy channel for Wesbury:
a small island that is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 49</a><div class="page-content">roughly equally close to Wesbury then to Mount September.
Orinnari said that he did not want two embassies in the two countries, one for each other, because
"Wesbury would have to design and construct an aesthetic build with a secure storage room because the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 49</a><div class="page-content">likelihood of someone committing a crime in Wesbury and fleeing to Mount September's borders is so much greater than the reverse”, also stating that it would take up the limited space in Wesbury.
Since this solution is a little complex, it was 
also proposed that
Mount September</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 49</a><div class="page-content">simply annex the island and Wesbury can build an embassy as private property, or that they can simply build in an already existing claim in MtS.
However, Wesbury would want to keep the embassy “at arms reach”, and when an alternative closer island was already</div></div>

Needless to say, negotiations with the Admiralty of Wesbury are quite tumultuous, we hope they go well.</div></div>
