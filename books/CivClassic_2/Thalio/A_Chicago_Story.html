<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Alright, I’m gonna bounce like all my bookie’s checks do”. I reply. I then exit that horrendous little store, and I realize that poor old Stanley is destined to die</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I order a drink, water on the rocks, and I turn to Louie. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

I knew what he wanted, and it would cost me, but I wouldn't get anything out of this</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Good man, Louie, good man.” I answer. Louie begins to get up to get more onions, but before he can leave I raise my hand.</div></div>
