By making claims, drawing imaginary lines and coloring in portions of landmasses on a map, the behemoth of an Empire took the first step in crushing this dream but laying de jure claim on the entire land</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 47</a><div class="page-content">But the dreamer does not take kindly to having his dream deprived from him, and so this brave collection of dreamers stand stalwart and ready to defend their dream.

<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Finally, the trumpets were sounded, signalling that mighty Senntisten was to finally begin her assault.

<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Their faces told all. They were ready to fight, and they were ready to die. No words were needed. And accordingly, the King looked back at the charging horde, raised his royal sword up high and simply let out a defiant yawp,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 47</a><div class="page-content">which signalled to the troops that they were to charge against the horde that opposed them. And with battlecries that would inspire Mars himself, the Balkanian army charged right into the bosom of the enemy unit, arms in hand and ready to use them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 47</a><div class="page-content">They broke into a full sprint, intent on unleashing the utmost berserker fury that they could muster against the invaders, who were now running against them and screaming aggressive yells of their own.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The King led the charge, running straight into Senntisten's lines. Contact between the two armies would come in mere seconds. And come it did, in a spectacular clash that made the earth rumble with its auditory volume</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 47</a><div class="page-content">and even sent men flying several feet into the air and knocked into the ground, for the momentum was so great that it almost matched the fury of the Balkanians.

<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 47</a><div class="page-content">In the chaos of it all, the screams could be heard in an instant as blood squirted out everywhere, often landing in one's face, eyes, and if he was unlucky enough to have his mouth agape, unto his tongue where he would feel the bitter taste</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 47</a><div class="page-content">of the death of a human being. But the fighting continued, and the slaughter's pace only picked up from the initial clash.

<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 47</a><div class="page-content">and all the men who were walking on this blood-drenched field felt they were stepping in a marsh, only to look down and discover that they treaded not upon bog water and thick roots of trees,</div></div>
