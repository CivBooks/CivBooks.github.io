<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Henry suddenly woke up covered in sweat. It was a rainy, humid night in the city of Mount Augusta. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was also a sexy night in the city of Mount Augusta.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Henry immediately threw on his pinstriped romper which made him look dummy thicc, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">rushed towards the ongoing festivities taking place at the 3rd floor of the CME exchange.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>When he arrived, he was immediately overcome with a peculiar stench, which was particularly gamey, yet enticing. DCHERO spotted him at the entryway and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">swam through the crowd to greet him.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What's up, retard?" DCHERO said, as he placed a firm smack on Henry's right buttcheek.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"DCHERO, I sincerely enjoyed you placing a firm smack on my right buttcheek," said Henry.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">"I'm glad to hear that,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>replied DCHERO.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Do you want to go somewhere... more private?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Henry quickly answered in a hushed voice, "If you're talking about your Hello Kitty themed sex dungeon, then I'm afraid I'm not interested."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">"Please, just this on-" DCHERO begged, but before he could finish, Henry stuck his entire fist in his mouth.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Henry gazed into DCHERO's eyes as he salivated around his hand. He thought he could hear him moaning, but he decided to ignore it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Henry withdrew his fist from DCHERO's velvety throat. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Babe, you tease me too much," proclaimed DCHERO.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Henry did not respond. He wanted too much from DCHERO, or maybe not enough. He was never sure. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">With one last longing gaze, Henry briskly walked away towards the punch bowl. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>While filling up his cup, he felt a hand creep up his rear. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"DCHERO, leave me alone!" Henry said, as he turned around, only to realize that it was actually</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">citylion, who had a sly smirk on his face.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Funny seeing you here, sweetcheeks," said citylion.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Henry gasped. He couldn't speak, as the shock of seeing his former lover overwhelmed him. He tried to, but he could only produce</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">strange garbled sounds that no one could understand.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Shh, shhh, it's alright," assured citylion. "We can finally be together once again.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I don't know if I can trust you with my feelings," replied Henry.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">"I think I still need time to... forget."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This mildly annoyed citylion. Being the chad he is, someone turning him down was not a familiar experience to him. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Henry looked on coldly, seeming unaffected by city's presence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">City couldn't comprehend why.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

CHAPTER 2: MAN LOVE

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He eventually briskly walked away like a millipede in a subway, formulating a plan to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">win back the love of his life. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>City was a broomstick handle, but this time, he wanted to be the bristles. He added one of Henry's acquaintances, DCHERO, on Snapchat.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Hey babe, u up?" read a particularly raunchy snap from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 13</a><div class="page-content">city. To his dismay, DCHERO left him on read. What a trifling ass hoe.
