<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Earl’s son Julius Rosenberg has two secrets.

First is the open secret that, despite being born a woman, he was brought up as a man for him to succeed the Earldom which lacks an heir.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 64</a><div class="page-content">People called “him” the Beautiful Crossdresser, and were charmed by his androgynous, dubious appeal. In addition, the second secret is…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 64</a><div class="page-content">The first secret is actually misunderstanding.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 64</a><div class="page-content">How one thought of themselves and how others perceived them might not always match.

No, it was said that it was only natural that there would be some degree of difference in how people perceived things.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 64</a><div class="page-content">The smaller the difference, the easier it was to achieve mutual understanding.

However, in contrast to this, mutual understanding would be impossible the bigger the difference, even if they exchanged hundreds of conversations.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“Look, it’s Julius-sama!”

“Julius-sama!? Where, where is he?!”

“He’s standing by the wall over there!"

“Ah, he’s as beautiful as ever!”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 64</a><div class="page-content">The young ladies of marriageable age, who were wearing colourful vivid dresses, made a commotion after they caught sight of the [young man] who was standing against the wall in the corner of the banquet hall, which was now holding a ball.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Their shrieks reached the ears of the person in question and the [young man] hand to his forehead and sighed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 64</a><div class="page-content">However, even such a troubling gesture was like a painting to the girls and they made a bigger commotion instead of calming down.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“Ah! He put his hand on his forehead and sighed!”

“The way he hides his melancholy look is also beautiful!”

“How dreamy……!”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“I wonder what’s troubling him. If he discussed it with me, I’ll help him as much as I can!”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 64</a><div class="page-content">The [young man], who attracted the attention of the young ladies of marriage age and caused them to fuss, had extremely beautiful features.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Instead of being filled with manly appeal, it was more appropriate to say that his appearance was one of delicate androgynous beauty and his features were really well proportioned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 64</a><div class="page-content">His face was currently narrowed with a melancholy look, but his blue eyes sparkled like sapphires.

His long blonde hair was flowing in loose waves and coupled with his looks, brought about an elegant aura.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 64</a><div class="page-content">His height was just above average, but he appeared taller because of his slender build.

His physique might appear frail at a glance, but if one observed closely, they would notice his well-trained hidden flexible muscles.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 64</a><div class="page-content">He was probably around 20 years old, judging from his outward appearance.

[His] name was Julius Rosenberg.

He was from a noble lineage of Aullène Kingdom, the eldest son of Earl Rosenberg.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 64</a><div class="page-content">However, hardly anyone in this kingdom recognised him as a man.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 64</a><div class="page-content">『Earl Rosenberg, who didn’t have any other heir, raised his new-born daughter as a man so that a direct descendant can succeed the line.』

It was an open secret that everyone knew.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 64</a><div class="page-content">This unfounded rumour spread amongst the noble society out of nowhere sometime after [his] birth into the Rosenberg Earldom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 64</a><div class="page-content">At that time, it was only to the extent of being a popular conversational topic, a mere piece of gossip, and the rumour vanished before long.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 64</a><div class="page-content">However, a problematic person showed up in the noble society and the rumour was revived. It quickly became more than a rumour, it became reality.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Before that, the [boy] who appeared was so dashing and beautiful, he hardly looked like a male.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 64</a><div class="page-content">[Beautiful crossdresser] ── everyone who knew [him] would agree that there were no words more suitable to describe him than these words.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 64</a><div class="page-content">[Beautiful crossdresser] was someone who had a body of a woman. Someone who tightly bound her abundant chest in a cloth and wore shirts and slacks instead of dresses. It referred to a woman that pretended to be a man.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 64</a><div class="page-content">However, even if she wore clothes meant for men, her femininity showed through her mannerism.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 64</a><div class="page-content">That would occasionally result in a dubious androgynous charm, one that fascinated people of all ages regardless of their gender.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 64</a><div class="page-content">In fact, there were a lot of people who yearned for Julius.

Julius’ popularity among younger ladies in particular was tremendous, and those who yearned for him secretly formed an organisation called the [Protection Squad].</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Of course, Julius was a noble but he wasn’t royalty, so it didn’t adhere with the original meaning of being a protection squad. It was merely an unofficial, informal group of volunteers who imitated real bodyguards.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 64</a><div class="page-content">But it was impossible to treat them as a laughing matter when this group, which was comprised of volunteers, almost doubled the number of the Crown Prince’s own guards.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 64</a><div class="page-content">In addition, the [Protection Squad] didn’t possess any military power because it was mainly composed of young ladies.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 64</a><div class="page-content"> However, it was a frightening group composed of most of the noble young ladies of Aullène Kingdom, there was danger of incurring immediate destruction to oneself if they thoughtless antagonised the group.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 64</a><div class="page-content">In fact, when the second son of a certain Viscount behaved rudely towards Julius, he received backlash from ladies all over the kingdom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 64</a><div class="page-content">His fiancée annulled their engagement and on top of that, clients stopped dealing business with their House.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 64</a><div class="page-content">As such, although Julius Rosenberg’s [real gender] was recognised as an open secret, he was still people’s object of admiration as the [Beautiful Crossdresser].</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 64</a><div class="page-content">However, he had another secret in addition to his open secret. One that only his relatives knew.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 64</a><div class="page-content">That is ──</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 64</a><div class="page-content">── [He was actually a man].</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 64</a><div class="page-content">





◊♦◊♦◊♦◊</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“Huh……? This again?”

Julius, who was standing at the corner wall of the banquet hall, sighed while placing his hand on his forehead, in reaction to the shrieks of the young ladies in dresses.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“You’re as popular as ever, Julius.”

“Won’t you give me a break, Maxián?”

Julius’s friend, Maxián Evryac was standing next to him joked with admiration, but he only received a tired answer in return.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Maxián Evryac was the second son of a Marquis and Julius’s friend since childhood.

He was a young man with short, light brown hair. He was also good looking, but he still gave off a masculine charm unlike the androgynous Julius.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 64</a><div class="page-content">He was the same age as Julius but he was slightly taller and had a larger build.

“There’s no need to be shy, is there?”

“No, I’m not being shy or anything……”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 64</a><div class="page-content">As a man, Julius was also glad to be seen favourably by beautiful woman.

…… However, that was only if their gazes were for [Julius as a man].</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 64</a><div class="page-content">The ladies’ admiration for him right now was for [beautiful crossdresser Julius] and it was different from one that was directed towards the real him. In other words, it was directed for a fictional character who didn’t exist.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Therefore, no matter how favourable the glances were, Julius felt intricate and couldn’t be happy about it.

“Haaa……”

“?”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Moreover, this wasn’t something that had started recently.

Julius realised that those around him thought that he was a woman when he became old enough to understand what was happening around him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 64</a><div class="page-content">No, it was more accurate to say that they misunderstood that he was [a woman pretending to be a man].

Of course, he himself knew that he was a male and flatly denied such misunderstandings.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-51"><a href="#page-51" class="page-indicator">Page 51 of 64</a><div class="page-content">He denied them, 
but ──</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-52"><a href="#page-52" class="page-indicator">Page 52 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“You all have some kind of misunderstanding, but I’m a man, you know?”

“Ah, poor you, Julius-sama. You’re saying such things because you have to become a sacrifice for the sake of your House.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-53"><a href="#page-53" class="page-indicator">Page 53 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“U-uh, huh? Do you really get it? I’m saying that I’m a man……”

“Yes, of course I understand. I will see to it that other people know it too, so please be at ease.”

“…… You really don’t get it, do you?”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-54"><a href="#page-54" class="page-indicator">Page 54 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“? Is something wrong? You look as if there is. If there’s anything I can do, please don’t hesitate to tell me.”

“…… No, I give up.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-55"><a href="#page-55" class="page-indicator">Page 55 of 64</a><div class="page-content">No matter how many times Julius personally declared that he was a man, the people around him interpreted it as [a strong woman who acted like a man and killed her true self in order to succeed their House] and he wasn’t taken seriously.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-56"><a href="#page-56" class="page-indicator">Page 56 of 64</a><div class="page-content">On the contrary, it resulted in sympathy.

It was difficult to overturn an assumption once it had been made. Julius knew this too well.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-57"><a href="#page-57" class="page-indicator">Page 57 of 64</a><div class="page-content">His body was clearly male, and people’s misunderstanding would surely clear up if he took off his clothes and got naked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-58"><a href="#page-58" class="page-indicator">Page 58 of 64</a><div class="page-content">But Julius, who had been strictly disciplined to constantly behave gracefully as a noble since childhood, couldn’t possibly undress in public.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-59"><a href="#page-59" class="page-indicator">Page 59 of 64</a><div class="page-content">For similar reasons, it was out of the question to make someone understand by getting them to touch his body. In the first place, it was impossible to solve the misunderstanding about his gender without letting them touch his fairly private parts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-60"><a href="#page-60" class="page-indicator">Page 60 of 64</a><div class="page-content">However, in reality, the education he had received was tailored more towards a certain side compared to the education of other noble men because of special circumstances.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-61"><a href="#page-61" class="page-indicator">Page 61 of 64</a><div class="page-content">So it was impossible to solve the misunderstanding. In the end, only a small fraction of his relatives knew that Julius was a man, and a great majority of people saw him as a beautiful crossdresser.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-62"><a href="#page-62" class="page-indicator">Page 62 of 64</a><div class="page-content">“…… My goodness.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-63"><a href="#page-63" class="page-indicator">Page 63 of 64</a><div class="page-content">Today as well, [beautiful crossdresser] Julius sighed as he was surrounded by shrieks.</div></div>
