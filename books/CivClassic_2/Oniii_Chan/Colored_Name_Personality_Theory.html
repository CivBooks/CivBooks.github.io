<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Despite being gifted a colored name, you are a person to feel ashamed for looking like you contributed to this anime server. To you, it is a deep dark secret that you can set the color of your name to something other than the default.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You are a person who hides when in small groups yet seeks out attention in large groups. When you speak in local chat, nobody can tell you have spent money on an anime server that rarely breaks 50 players.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">However, whenever you speak in global chat, everyone takes a second look. Rumor is, people you message instantly have a stroke.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You are White's antithesis. On the tab screen everyone knows of your status, yet when you speak in global chat nobody notices you. When you're helping newfriends in local chat however, you seem like a helpful person of authority.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You are an anime fan on an anime server. You can't help but politely post anime memes in the discord. If you aren't already in Gensokyo, you visit it regularly and admire its architecture.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You were once important in the past, however in recent times you have taken a back seat in the server and simply let events pass by. Even so, you are a respected player who can give out your seal of approval to whatever you please.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You are an antagonist for someone. You have done things someone doesn't like you for, and their goal in life is to wrong you.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Be it pearling, seeking reps, or getting you banned from a city, the person for which you are an antagonist wishes you bad.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You are a mysterous player. Despite being commonly on the tab menu, few people know your name. You may be important behind the scenes, or you may simply be a peaceful wheat farmer. Who knows, maybe you've got admin on the mir</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You are a technical player. You spend much time trying to figure out how to fit a hopper contraption into the chunk limit, usually by exploiting the intersection of four chunks. You are rich past what you can spend, not through mining or</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You are the chill older brother of the server. You are universally liked, even among your enemies.
