  MANIAC ON ITS WAY!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Do you have any idea how much I love vending machines?

I’m willing to pay for a new item in a vending machine even when I’m broke and can’t pay my electricity bill.

Does that mean I only love the goods rather than the machine?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 54</a><div class="page-content">No, no, no, I love both of them. I particularly love the imposing design of the vending machine, how it contains a variety of unique products. To me, it’s nothing short of a treasure chest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I even love the disgusting, overly carbonated soft drinks. Truly a drink which doesn’t suit it’s temperature. If I don’t buy it, someone else will. So, why not?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 54</a><div class="page-content">There are not only drinks but various snacks and breads that get warmed automatically inside the machine.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Of course, it’s not only food, there’s stationary, clothes, socks, even adult items. All found in a vending machine. If you’re not charmed then don’t blame me for calling you crazy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Vending machines are truly amazing in this day and age, with their unique varieties. I even went on a hunt for a machine which I became interested in through the internet. Man, it was a great trip.  All the pictures are in my secret folder.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I, who is in love with the glorious Vending Machine, was struck down by the very same thing. Man, such irony.

A truck transporting a vending machine got in an accident and before I knew it the machine came flying at me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Now that I think about it, I could’ve survived if only I tried, but I was stunned by the majestic look of the new vending machine. I even felt obliged to help the Vending machine, so I tried to save it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 54</a><div class="page-content">What would happen to a person trying to catch something that weighs over 400kg without goods inside, and 800kg when it is full?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Unsurprisingly…you get smashed into pieces.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 54</a><div class="page-content">This is how a Vending Machine Maniac died because of his instinct.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I thought my story was supposed to end there. But in reality, it had just begun. I, who was hugging cold steel while drifting into an eternal sleep, suddenly woke up.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I felt relieved that I wasn’t actually dead but I was also worried about the vending machine that fell.

When I came to, I was standing close to an unknown lake. I couldn’t move or speak, and it felt like my senses were cut off from the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I wanted to shout something out at random, but what came out of my mouth was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 54</a><div class="page-content">





— “Welcome.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I never intended for that word to come out of my mouth. I quietly reaffirmed my sanity, and came to the conclusion it must have been someone else’s voice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I calmed myself and tried again</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 54</a><div class="page-content">





–“Thank you.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 54</a><div class="page-content">It was supposed to be my voice but it sounded too lucid and clear. It was really weird. I never meant to speak this clearly. However, when I tried talking, it just came naturally.

With full concentration, this time for sure!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 54</a><div class="page-content">–“Please come again.”





–“Unlucky.”





–“You won!”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 54</a><div class="page-content">This wording feels familiar. I’ve heard it many times in my life so I shouldn’t be wrong. This is the sound of my favorite vending machine brand.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 54</a><div class="page-content">No way, it can’t be something this absurd. I know I loved vending machines for which I will die for, it’s impossible for me to be reborn as a vending machine right?

I can even see the world outside.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Sky with small strands of cloud floating, a huge lake right in front of me. This place seems to be in lakeside. I saw my reflection in the water below me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 54</a><div class="page-content">A white and tall rectangular body, elegant machinery attached, a perfectly styled machine. Behind the lustrous glass, was a bottle of mineral water and a small can of corn soup next to each other, truly a work of art done by a master of beauty.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 54</a><div class="page-content">A gentle double layer which seemed to be able to withstand the storms and disasters, a can costing only 100 yen, a bottle of water for 130 yen, such humble prices with so much … shit, this is a vending machine isn’t it?!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 54</a><div class="page-content">wwwwwwwwwhhhhhh, there’s no way right, it’s gotta be a lie! Reincarnating into a vending machine after death, its the worst…not. Being able to reincarnate as my favorite thing, can be nothing other that a god given gift!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Wait but hmmm…just because you like cars doesn’t necessarily mean that you want to be a car. Well, in kindergarten there was this one brat who cried while saying he wanted to be a police car.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Either way, nothing can be done about it now I guess. The sad part about being a maniac is that I’m almost glad about becoming a machine.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Crying won’t help. It doesn’t feel quite right but I gotta stop running from reality. I shouted again to try and get rid of my anxiety.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 54</a><div class="page-content">





–“You Win.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Shut up, me.

Anything I try to say will come out as one of the pre-recorded lines of the machine. By trying many times, I’ve more or less figured out what I can say.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 54</a><div class="page-content">–“Welcome.”

— “Thank you very much.”

— “Please come again.”

–“If you win, you get another one for free.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 54</a><div class="page-content">— “Unlucky.”

–“You Win.”

–“Please pay the balance by inserting coins.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Only these ones, huh. Well, better than nothing. It’s definitely impossible to have a proper conversation with anyone though. Even if someone were to come by, they would get scared hearing a vending machine talk in such an unorthodox and repetitive way.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Even though I’m giving up on communication there has to be something else I can do. Hmm, something a vending machine can do… Of course! Selling goods!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I don’t see any customers around though. Without customers, will it really be ok? I don’t think anyone is dumb enough to put a vending machine in an isolated place, so someone should come around sooner or later.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 54</a><div class="page-content">This place looks like it could be a tourist spot. Maybe there is a mansion or something on the lakeside. Even if there are no customers, maintenance guys should come around to check on the stock and condition of the machine.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I might as well start searching for a way to communicate, for the future. It would be nice if I could move my body, but I’ve tried a couple times and had no luck. I can play the pre-recorded sounds with just my will though. Well, it would be scary if arms and legs grew out of my body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Isn’t there something I can do… I’ve been replaying the pre-recorded sounds over and over again. Meaning that I do have some control over the functions in my body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 54</a><div class="page-content">Inserting money to buy a product is the main function of the vending machine. That’s it, huh. Maybe there is a way I can get the goods out without paying… I might as well try it since I have nothing better to do.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 54</a><div class="page-content">First, let’s figure out my own body’s functions. I can accept that I’m a vending machine and not a human. Parts, electrodes, and goods are my muscles, skeleton, and organs. My voice is pre-recorded audio.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 54</a><div class="page-content">No arms or legs, unfortunately. I’m calm right now, is this a sign that I have accepted the reality of my situation? Think cool, act hotly. Just like the separation between hot and cold drinks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 54</a><div class="page-content">That was the kind of nonsense going through my head for the last couple hours.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 54</a><div class="page-content">I am a vending machine. Humans can move their body through their own free will. As a vending machine, I should be more than capable of understanding my own functions. Believe! Become!

I am a vending machine!!!</div></div>
