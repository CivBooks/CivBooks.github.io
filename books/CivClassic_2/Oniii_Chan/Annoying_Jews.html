<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 11</a><div class="page-content">In early October 2019, Figasaur, builder of the Icenia Jewish Quarter, was pearled by MtA over a judgement from a court case a few months ago. He threw a temper tantrum since he was pearled riding the rail line from Icenia to 0,0.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">He claimed this line was Icenia territory, and he should have been protected on this line. Before anyone could calm him, he began demolishing the JQ, leveling a few buildings and defacing them all.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Included was Icenia's factory buildings, in which he broke the factories that he did not own. He also broke factories in a newfriend district factory building, as he was on the group they were reinforced on.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content">After a few hours of demolishing under the guise of "Rebuilding the JQ from schematics", he was upgraded to PrisonPearl to stop his tantrum. This left the JQ in a state of partial demolition, and over the course of a few weeks the griefed buildings were manually removed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">using Acid Blocks with help from Quanton_Biscut and friends. I also laid claim to this very building, which was mostly untouched. We rebuilt Jah Park from schematics, but to distance oursels from the now toxic fig, we began the process of building anew in the freed up plots.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">A church to goblin has already been built, and a schematic for a tower to replace the old JQ's clock tower has been finished, awaiting finished demolition of the clock tower's remains.
Fig is forever disregarded from Iceinia's future, and</div></div>

Icenia's future without annoying fake jews looks bright, even in the face of the summer's end and the lower player counts</div></div>

I wrote this sign wall soon after the events described on this sign wall to fill space in the workbench warehouse. Since then, even more plots have been filled, including a shop that showed up overnight, and some weird tower obtainable spat built. I write this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 11</a><div class="page-content">book one year after these events, in case something happens to the sign wall. In addition, since I never named that wall of signs, I give it the name Annoying Fake Jews.</div></div>
