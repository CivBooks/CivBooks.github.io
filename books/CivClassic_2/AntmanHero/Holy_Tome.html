Genesis

Once there was nothing.
Nothing was run by The Lord, who had created worlds before.
But now this world would be the true world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">He created the sun and the moon, and then the world.
At the dawn of time, the world was a cube of water.
But God then spawned the +,-.
First came the Chanseatic lands, then Nueva Luzon.
Third came the Nyasa lands.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Slowly the world took form, with the -,- coming, then the +,+, and finally the -,+.
As the world was finished, life would be born.
First came the creatures of the sea, then the plants, and finally the creatures of land.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 10</a><div class="page-content">But as The Lord stared down at his creation, he felt a feeling of emptiness.
For there was no one civilized, no one to plow the fields, to build him monuments, to produce literary works, to spread joy and cheer.
And so, in his own image, The Lord created man.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Placing them in a land of beauty named Grantlee, in the third region created, the first humans were born.
A man named Steve, a woman named Alex.
One born under the sun, one under the moon.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Settling in the mountains, the two were given fruit and food to feast upon.
Anything they’d desire, they’d be given.
All but one; from a single tree sprouted beautiful red apples.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 10</a><div class="page-content">The Lord told his children that they may have whatever they asked, that they may be free from harm, free from death.
But they must not consume the forbidden fruit.
The children agreed, and for a time, there was peace in the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 10</a><div class="page-content">But the peace would not last.
For the humans were tempted by the primordial seed of sin; Greed.
For they had had all they wished for, they desired more.
So one day, when the sun was low, they plucked the apple from the tree, and consumed it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 10</a><div class="page-content">When the Lord came, he saw what had happened.
He was not mad, but disappointed, for his children had proven the true nature of man.
The Lord cast his children down from the mountains, down onto the Earth, and closed the gates of Grantlee.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 10</a><div class="page-content">“Now, my son, my daughter,  you shall live among your kind.”
And so, humanity was struck down, and sent to live amongst their fellow animals.
From this humanity spawned, but the grace and perfection of God was absent, and humans would remain as animals.</div></div>
