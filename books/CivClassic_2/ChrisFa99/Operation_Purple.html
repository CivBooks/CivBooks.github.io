We sought to do this in order to retaliate against hostile nations without risking being held responsible or implicated in our own attack.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Test Log 1: Initial testing phase experiment began with a 4x4 grid consisting of 1 mycelium block, and 3 dirt blocks. This initial experiment was simply to verify the ability of the mycelium to pass from one block to another.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Test Log 2: This experiment consisted of a 5x8 grid. 3 groups of 2 mycelium blocks were placed, a total of 6. 5 Grass blocks were placed in the grid to observe their interactions. 7 new mycelium blocks were created. The grass appeared to hinder the growth</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Test Log 2 (CONT.): Further testing must be done to assert the full interactions between mycelium blocks and grass and how to circumvent the hinderance of grass on mycelial growth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Test Log 3: This test was to deal with grass limiting the ability of the mycelium to spread. We sought to find a way to easily remove grass from large areas of land and convert it to dirt. Initially we used buckets of water for this. However this proved</div></div>

We then turned to lava to solve this problem and this was just as inconclusive, however, we accidentally stumbled upon a potential breakthrough when trying to contain the subsequent lava spillage from the testing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Test Log 3 (CONT.): It appears that placing blocks above the grass can eventually remove the grass, further testing will need to be done in order to deem whether this may be an effective method for grass removal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Test Log 4: In this test we wanted to further investigate the effects of placing blocks above grass to remove it. It worked but was semi inefficient due to the fact that blocks needed to be individually placed above the grass.</div></div>

Once the grass was removed the mycelium seemed to grow at a faster rate than in previous experiments. It is believed that this was due to an initial higher concentration of</div></div>

This suggests that mycelial growth is exponential. During this test the mycelium was observed spreading diagonally as opposed to just one direction. It is also interesting to note that no grass grew</div></div>

This led us to consider using sheep as agents in Operation Purple. We then studied the grazing habits of sheep and deemed that to be less effective than placing blocks above the grass.</div></div>

After this experiment, the destruction of 300 sheep was ordered. Upon completion of this operation, this log</div></div>

A new testing field was created in order to investigate this. It was a 5x8 grid with a line of mycelium and grass at each end with a dirt buffer between. We</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Test Log 6 (CONT.): We then waited to investigate the spread to see if there were similarities between the two spread patterns and speeds.

This means that operation purple might not be that possible due to the fact that any grass removed may just grow back before the mycelium can spread, unless we</div></div>

We investigated the required Light Levels (Ll) for mycelium to spread. It was determined that the mycelium itself needs 9Ll to be eligible to spread, and the</div></div>

When the light of a mycelium subject falls below 4Ll, it will revert to it's natural state, a dirt block. These conditions of spread are uniform between mycelium and grass. Further</div></div>

We wanted to see if mycelium could spread downwards. We found that it could in fact spread downwards so long as it was within 1 block in terms of X or Z coordinate, however, the mycelium</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Test Log 8 (CONT.): could be within 3 blocks in terms of Y coordinates. This spread was discovered due to the mycelium escaping the testing field and spreading to the area directly below the testing field. It is unsure what implications these results have</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Conclusion: It is with a heavy heart that we must cease our testing for Operation Purple. We believe that this operation would be too impractical to enact due to the requirement for dirt in order for mycelium to spread and the fact that grass would need</div></div>

The area required for this operation to be effective would be simply too big. This would make the operation no longer Covert and Gabon would be held accountable for the mycelial spread.</div></div>
