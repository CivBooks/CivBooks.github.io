<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Start in the morning. Rather than practising astral projection at night, right before you go to sleep, start in the early morning hours when you're still feeling drowsy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Some say that it's easier to reach the necessary state of relaxation and heightened awareness around dawn. Yet it is possible to astral travel at any time so there are no hard and fast rules.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Create the right atmosphere. Astral projection requires a state of deep relaxation, so it should be performed in a part of your home where you're completely comfortable. Lie on your bed or sofa and relax your mind and body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 33</a><div class="page-content">It's easier to perform astral projection alone than it is with someone else in the room. If you usually sleep with a partner, choose a room other than the bedroom to practice astral projection.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 33</a><div class="page-content"> A good time to do it is when no one else is in and make sure no one is going to walk into the room when you're in astral flight.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Draw the shades or curtains and rid the room of distracting noises.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 33</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Lie down and relax. Position yourself on your back in your chosen room. Close your eyes and try to clear your mind of distracting thoughts. Concentrate on your body and how it feels.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Flex your muscles and then loosen them. Start with your toes and work your way up your body, gradually making your way to your head.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Make sure every muscle is completely relaxed when you are through.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Breathe deeply and exhale completely. Don't hold tension in your chest and shoulders, just relax.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Focus your mind on your breathing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Don't get carried away with thoughts of outside worries, and don't get preoccupied yet with the idea of your soul projecting from your body. Just let yourself sink into relaxation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 33</a><div class="page-content">It can be helpful to use a quartz crystal to raise and speed up your vibrations as preparation. Gently hold the crystal on your third eye slightly above the centre of your eyebrows with closed eyes and breathing deeply.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 33</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Reach a hypnotic state. This hypnotic state is normally known as the hypnagogic state. Let your body and mind approach sleep, but don't completely lose consciousness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Being at the edge of wakefulness and sleep, a hypnotic state, is necessary for astral projection to occur. Reach this state using the following method.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Keeping your eyes closed, let your mind wander to a part of your body, such as your hand, foot or a single toe.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Focus on the body part until you can visualize it perfectly, even with your eyes closed. Continue focusing until all other thoughts fall away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Use your mind to flex your body part, but do not physically move it. Visualize your toes curling and uncurling, or your fingers clenching and unclenching, until it seems as though they are physically moving.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Broaden your focus to the rest of your body. Move your legs, your arms, and your head using only your mind. Keep your focus steady until you're able to move your whole body in your mind alone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Enter into a state of vibration. Many report feeling vibrations, which come in waves at different frequencies, as the soul prepares to leave the body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Don't be afraid of the vibrations, since the presence of fear might cause you to leave your meditative state; instead, succumb to the vibrations as your soul prepares to leave your body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Use your mind to move your soul from your body. Imagine in your mind the room in which you are lying. Move your body in your mind to stand up. Look around yourself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Your OBE is successful if you feel as though you are gazing upon your body from across the room, and that your conscious self is now separate from your body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 33</a><div class="page-content">It takes a lot of practice to get to this point for some people, though for others it comes as naturally as breathing. Either way it is possible for everyone if it is desired and practised enough!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Return to your body. Your soul always remains connected to your body with an invisible force, sometimes referred to as a "silver cord." Let the force guide your soul back to your body.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Re-enter your body. Move your fingers and toes - physically, not just in your mind - and let yourself regain full consciousness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Confirm that you are projecting your soul from your body. Once you have mastered the act of projecting your soul from your body in the same room, you will want to confirm that you were indeed in two separate planes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Next time you practice the astral projection, don't turn around to look at your body. Instead, leave the room and walk into another room in the house.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Examine an object in the other room, something that you had never noticed before in the physical sense.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Return to your body. Physically go into the room you previously projected yourself into. Walk to the article you examined during the astral travel. Can you confirm the details you noted when you explored the object with your mind?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Explore further. During subsequent astral projection sessions, go to locations that are less and less familiar to you. Each time, note details that you had never noticed before. After each session, physically verify the details.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 33</a><div class="page-content">After a few trips, you will be experienced enough to travel to locations that are completely unfamiliar with the confidence that you have actually performed astral projection.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Some say that astral projection is dangerous, especially when one gets enough practice to explore unfamiliar places but it need not be.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Those people simply don't understand it or fear it because they don't use enough protection,.as long as you ask for protection in your own way it'll be a good experience.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Before you astral project it is nice to imagine yourself bathed in a glowing, white light. Imagine it as a cloud around you or inside you; this will protect you from other thought forms or negative energy forms.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 33</a><div class="page-content">The silver cord can never be broken, but it is said that your soul can be delayed from re-entering your body if you spend too much energy outside of it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Your soul can also interact with other astral projections. Try it with a friend who has practiced as much as you have. Some say astral sex is mind blowing.</div></div>
