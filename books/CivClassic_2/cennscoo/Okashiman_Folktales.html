<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>or craft of the world around. He had not yet discovered the arts of breaking open the fruits and grains born of the ground.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Instead, man wandered<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the world. Ranging far<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>and near from the familiar, ever moving.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 28</a><div class="page-content">At one occasion, a day<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>came that man met a fellow beast in the woods, a creature he knew to give meat and warm fleece.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A sheep. It lay upon the ground, wounded from the snap of a snake's bite, though it had crushed the beastling dead.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The man readied his strike, but the sheep stayed him with a plea.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I know you seek my fur to warm your bare skin and my meat to fill your thin belly. But hear me. Take of my fur alone, and let me partake foods we shan't quarrel over. Let us be brethren."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The man stayed his hand and took the beast home to nurse it, thinking it wise.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>His brethren cast wary eyes, hungry eyes, but they allowed<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>this for now. They watched the sheep grow stronger and fuller.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">One night, the man went out to sit beside the sheep. He wore of its fur, and the sheep a lighter coat for it.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I wish all of my kind could know this warmth," said the man.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Then comb the fur from my kin too, and comb it into your pastures."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">But man did not dwell in pastures, and so the problem was pondered.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One night sometime later, the sheep came to the man. It said to him, "Comb the fur from my kind and wind it among the trees of your fire. Be like the moon, a glow in the white."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">And so the man guided his kin to comb the sheep and its kin, and they gathered the fur up to shelter themselves. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But their fire leapt up and roared through the camp. Some fled north, while others hid away in the hills of the forest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">After traveling north for many days and nights, the man and his kin came to an immense water. It was known to them, but never before had they regarded it so joyously. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Over the land on the distant horizon, the moon began its ascent in the dusk.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"Here we will knit of the sheep's fur," said the man. "We will keep it away from our fires, and bring wood away from the forest to stretch it between."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And lo, the sheep came<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>to them from over the hills, to stand beside man as he tried.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">More fires would rise, but the man's kin stood ready to greet them. From the mush of the water's bank, man began to learn the tending of fruits.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And that is why our houses glow warmly, with pale walls around them. The moon is not out of reach.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>The Tale<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">It is said that man did teach itself of the ways of bartering and<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>lending of goods, to the benefit of all.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But wherefore springs<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the origin of the splays and spreads of the open markets, now? Hush, and you will hear of it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Once, long ago, two came upon one another, at a place where wild waters meet placid sands. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Blandly, they faced one another, seeming removed of colorful visage. They held their tools of trade at the ready, full up with mistrust.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Finally, one ventured, "Sir, have you need of cane? It grows here, strong and thick."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And the other to he said, "Aye, I need it. Is it yours, then? Have you nurtured it, sung to it, brought it to seed time and again?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">And to this the first, the farmer, nodded. "Have you fish? We could trade, one for the other, and claim bounties of our lack."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And so they did.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Time passed, and again and again the two met to trade their goods.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">But it was a wide world about, with many sands and many beaches. One day, the fisher returned and had nothing to trade.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Have you not fished?" asked the farmer.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Nay, I have," said the fisher.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 28</a><div class="page-content">This puzzled the farmer. "Then where are they? Do you not wish to trade?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Oh, I have traded," said the fisher. "There are places far and wide, with many things, and I have traded with those with the sea's fortunes."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">This distressed the farmer, who was left to a meal of salt water and sugar cane for want of a fish.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In the night, he awoke in enlightenment, an idea having struck. "There are other farmers out there," said he, "And there must be other fishers."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 28</a><div class="page-content">But how to attract them?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Ancient Okashiman wisdom drew him to the summit of a nearby hill, where dwelt the grandlamb of his grandfather's sheep.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He patted the sheep, and lay beside it in the moonlight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 28</a><div class="page-content">After a time of talking in the quiet of the evening, the man was feeling quite tired.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was then that the sheep turned to him, and said, "Where the moon rises, no sailor can deny the sight of it."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The wisdom struck the farmer soundly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 28</a><div class="page-content">And having lay beside the sheep and gained wisdom, the farmer went back down to shear of the flock.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He dipped the wool in strong dyes, bright colors which he stretched upon a series of new buildings<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>at the edge of the waters.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 28</a><div class="page-content">In no time at all, a ship pulled up along the beach, and a fisher walked to one of the stalls. But the man was ready for him, waiting behind it.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What do you have?" wondered the fisher.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Ah, only the best of sugar here," assured the farmer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 28</a><div class="page-content">And so he traded with the fisher, sugar for fish.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then the fisher went to the next stall. But the man was ready for him.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What have you here?" asked the fisher.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"Ah, only the best of papers," said the farmer.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And they traded, paper for fish. And the fisher went to the next stall. But the man was ready for him.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"What have you here?" asked the fisher.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"Ah, only the best of papyrus soup!" said the farmer.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>They almost traded, but the fisher then looked puzzled, and he said, "Are you trying to pull the wool over my eyes, sir?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>To which the farmer said, "Certainly not!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 28</a><div class="page-content">And so it goes. Since that day, the colorful splay of stalls has decorated the waterfront of the city, welcoming fishers and explorers of all stripes.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Alas, due to the events of that day, papyrus soup is no longer traditional cuisine.</div></div>
