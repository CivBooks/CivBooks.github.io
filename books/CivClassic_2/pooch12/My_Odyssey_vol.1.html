<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------Jul 5 '17<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1: I'm taking a short vacation from Yoahtl after the whole Laconia shitshow (3300 12000) and heading to Commonwealth (-7000 5000). Wish me luck.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">2: I head north by boat, passing by Mt. Doom of Laconia (3400 11500) and sailing along the coast of the icy wasteland known as the Popec. The coastline stretches east to around x: 3660 by z: 11000, then recedes west, which I follow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">3: The coast rapidly recedes south for a large bay around 3470 10860 so I head northwest into the open ocean.... to run into what seems to be the bay's other side at 3300 10750. I continue along this coast until it curves southwest at 3150 10650. Now I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">truly head into the open ocean... or so I thought, colliding with the Popec's icy shores at 2850 10530, before continuing into what is probably actually the open seas.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>4. I run into icy mountainous wasteland once more at 2230 10230. I have no idea if this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">is still the Popec, but it forces me to adjust my sailing southwest somewhat, as the coast runs from southwest to northeast. Fortunately, it starts receding northwest at 2115 10370, so I follow it- turning out to be a bay and quickly resuming its prior</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">orientation. Blah.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>5. By 1870 10560, the coast starts running southeast, which would take me back home. It would seem that I am forced to trek across this icy tundra over land... and as I disembark from my boat, it vanishes. At least there's a birch</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">tree here, which can supply wood for another boat. Shockingly, I find signs of life here- torches and basic dirt constructions. I follow a birch-lined snowy valley northward along x: 1830, passing a few seemingly meaningless cobblestone structures.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">6. The valley opens into a plain northwestward, following it to what appears to be a frozen lake, on the other side of which is a... desert?! This just got confusing. For some reason, there's also a herd of sheep, which I shear. I don't think anybody has</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">been here, as I see plentiful wild cacti. I wander the desert northwestward, gathering the cacti I find in my way. I find that this desert has many a treacherous lava lake as well, and other sheep herds.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>7. I eventually find a stick that someone dropped,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">with a small hole in the sand nearby that looks dug out by another traveller. I meet a large herd of cows at this point and, well, let's just say that I am not friendly towards them. I discover several more herds, which meet a similar fate, yielding much</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">beef and leather. Back home, my snitches are being spammed by possible ruffians. Ugh.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>8. By 900 9960, I find a sand suicide pillar, as well as a coastline. I also see some dirt in the distance, obviously atrificially placed. After gathering up the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">wild sugarcane along the bay here, I once more begin sailing- for a bit, anyways, before meeting a desert once more at 675 9890. It is much more flat and barren than the one I crossed previously, with scattered ponds. The F3 menu classifies this seeming</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">desert as a beach, which is odd, but I run back into desert at 470 9760, very similar to the one with the animal herds. It looks pristine and untouched, but I find 48 dropped cobblestone at 320 9715. Perhaps I am not alone. I find more sticks at 20 9590.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">9. At z: 9580, I cross from the +,+ quadrant into the -,+ quadrant, finding more animal herds. As I travel, I find more odd signs that another traveller was here before me.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>10. By -740 9270, I meet a taiga forest, which I enter. Within, I find</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">both standard spruce trees and giant ones towering over the land. By -1060 8980, I find a large river, which I sail north along... finding a mesa on my right and a taiga on my left as the river curves west into a larger body of water at -1250 8850.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I swear, these biome changes aren't realistic at all. I sail northwest along the coast of more taiga before it curves northeast by -1540 8575. I get off the boat and start walking again.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>11. Suddenly, I meet large, snowcapped hills at -1640 8530.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The hills have sporadic snow in the higher places, with plentiful oak trees. A high, odd-shaped cliff at -1750 8490 has pumpkins before the landscape fades into a dull oak forest, stretching to the northwest, meeting sporadic snowy sky islands along the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">way, meeting another sea at -2130 8400. I get off the boat again on the other side of what turns out to be a chain of lakes at -2790 7960, then start walking through more slightly snowy, dull oak forest until meeting more water at -2860 7920.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">12. On the other side of this lake (-2980 7790) I find a massive red sand cliff, climbing it into a red sand desert. At the other end, -3100 7630, I find a river between it and more dull snowy oak forest, which I take north into a large lake.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">13. Following this lake's west coast along a Popec-like landscape and another red sand cliff, I reach a mesa at its northwest corner (-3400 6990) and climb up it to an arid plateau with sporadic, dried-out oak trees, shared with more red deserts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">14. At the red desert's west end at -3990 6860, I meet a river cutting between the desert and high, snowy mountains topped with small oak trees. I dig up some more cobblestone and sandstone, then build a bridge over. I carefully descend down the steep</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">mountain into a dull oak forest again, finding a lonely bed at -4070 6830, running back into snowy mountains at -4200 6750. Oh my fucking god this is so boring and I will find an alternate route home if it kills me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">15. I finally find a river going northwest at -4540 6560, and take it.... which actually goes northeast. Ugh goddamnit please just get me to an ocean. Fuck this now I'm just going to go up to that bridge at -4430 6330 and going over land, into basically</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the same old shit except with some spruce trees now. HOLY SHIT THIS MAP IS LAZY.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>16. I run back into water at -4760 6200, running into the same old tired shit a couple hundred blocks later except much higher. At least the water opens up towards the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">northwest.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>17. I FINALLY HIT the open ocean around -5050 5900 or so.. until hitting a giant savanna plateau at -6510 5450. Ugh. At least it's different this time, and there's a waterfall I can climb.... then promptly have to go back down at -6560 5470</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> and hit the water again for what is hopefully the last part of this journey.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>18. I finally pull up to a jungle cliff near -7040 5120, only to be ambushed by a squad of skelly horses. I see people talking in general chat. I'm here!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Jul 6 '17<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1. I logged off in CW yesterday, as the journey here made me too bored to keep exploring. It's a thriving hub of commerce with many beautiful houses and shops, as well as a huge Shopside market underground. The people here</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">seem to be friendly so far, despite the town's emphasis on security- divided into 3 segments by trenches and with winding roads difficult to navigate for nonlocals like myself. One narrow bridge on the north side connects the west, middle, and east parts</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">while convoluted and narrow roads snake through the city, which is based in a savanna next to a jungle. The jungle is undeveloped as it is to be a national park, according to public notices.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>2. There is also a bridge to a snowy landmass across a river to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the north. It is sparsely colonized with some farms, with some mines too, along with a few houses. One of the roads here snakes down along a cliff face into low plains, covered in oak trees. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>3. I walk west, until the oak trees thin out and I meet grass</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">paths. Following them south and west leads me to their farms, and continuing onwards leads me to another bridge leading to the main part of CW, past/through a major house-looking building: through to the surface, around to the left to Shopside.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">4. Returning to the path and taking it northeastward, snaking a very long way through the plains, leading up to an independent homestead at its north end. I meet a couple of friends there, then turn back. Coords classified to protect them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">5. I return to Commonwealth proper and explore Shopside more in depth, and photograph the town. To my pleasant surprise, several transcribed books are available at one shop (-7060 5030), with a few other enterprises in other plots selling various goods.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Another shop, very fortunately, sells jungle items (-7060 5050)... well, fortunate if I had brought along the iron to buy it. I ought to come back and buy all these assorted goodies.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>6. I travel around town and get some good photos. I also hear about a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">book donation thing going on at 4220 -3120. It sounds like an interesting alternate route home, or at least more interesting than my trip here. By the way, an album of Commonwealth: <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>imgur.com/a/lM071</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">7: I sail away from CW via the river into the ocean until I hit a mesa's beach at -6300 4780. I walk north until I hit plains, then find a small farm and cave dwelling at -6190 4470, after which I run into more sea. Sailing it northeast brings me to a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Popec-like ice mountain wasteland at -5730 3920, hiking north through a valley to more sea at -5730 3760.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>8. I meet a peninsula of plains at -5130 3300, at which I unexpectedly find a blaze spawner. Fortunately, the rain kills them off so I can</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">deactivate the spawner with torches and continue my sailing.... which doesn't actually work, but I still get away in time.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>9. I find another plains landmass at -4730 3000, to find, rather surprisingly, a fort looking like a medieval castle. It appears</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to be a house, as I cannot enter and there are signs saying not to grief the owner, as well as a road and some farms to the southeast. I suspected a town here, but it might just be a hermit with an extremely massive farm, a few factories at 0 health, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">an enchanting table. Other visitors have been here to criticize the owner of all this, and I leave my own sign here. I also find a nether biome just east of the home before sailing away. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>10. I meet a much larger nether landmass at -3820 2700, with a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">blaze spawner right there to greet me, as well as a wall of tall mountains with tons of lavafalls. Fun! I track northeast through a pass full of treacherous lavafalls, making the way with my trusty waterbucket, before it ends at yet another blaze spawner.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I resign myself to scaling the mountains. They don't call this hell for nothing... and then I revise the plan to tunneling through after the fucking blazes start trying to jump me again. Luckily, it's a short distance to a bay on the other side, allowing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">me to leave.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>...<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>11. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>...and<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> then I run into another goddamn hell biome at -2470 2110. Luckily, this one is more forgiving, and I get to the other side at -2270 2000. I waste no time sailing away.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>12. At -1810 1510, I meet a mushroom island.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Finally, some friendly terrain. I cross it, then depart for 0,0 - hopefully with no more obstacles.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>13. At -940 540, I meet a taiga landmass, presumably that of 0,0. I just hope nobody jumps me, then this was all for nothing, as I'll lose this book.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And then I find it isn't. Oh well, time to actually (hopefully) sail for 0,0 now. I hear a couple of strangers converse in global and wonder if I'm safe.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>14. At -340 160, I meet another taiga landmass, presumably 0,0's this time, to find it is owned by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Westeros. At least these people don't hold a grudge against me. I find that this is just a northerly peninsula of their landmass, and go south/southeast until I reach a scattery stone path, along with some swearing block grief. It goes nowhere but I find</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">a tiny hut at -190 390. No other signs of civilization are discernable, so I just head to 0,0- but find another small hut at -90 320, as well as a sign post indicating this island is merely reserved for Westeros' future capital city. Moving on.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">15. At 0,0, I find a shockingly ugly dug-out island with a couple tiny DRO cubes about, plus an abandoned dog. I briefly enter the shallowest part of the -,- possible along the island's north barrier before reaching 0,0 itself; a lonely rose beneath a DRO</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">cube and some cobble thing.
