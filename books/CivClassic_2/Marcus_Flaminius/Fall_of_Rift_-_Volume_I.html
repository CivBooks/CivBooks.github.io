<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It wasn't the first time he or any of the other scouts had found signs of activity in the jungles outside of Rift. Will was finally able to convince Tux and Liam that there were indeed people hiding in the jungle<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 34</a><div class="page-content">for the past week, maybe even longer. "It's probably one of the statists from the far West," Liam said, "heard tales of the thriving Ancap cities of the positive, negatives."Will was less convinced. The statist cities were far away, and contact had<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 34</a><div class="page-content">already been made between Rift and Aristopolis. "You're saying they're jealous of our hole in the ground?" Tux jested to Liam. "Aye, tis such a pretty hole," Liam retorted, as the trio entered the grand city of the Rift.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 34</a><div class="page-content">The city was buzzing with life. Each level, from the top melon farms, the trading post, apartment rooms, all the way down to the depths of the earth itself, Rift was thriving. Will decided to go to his friend Matticus about his recent findings. "I'll<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 34</a><div class="page-content">meet you guys in The Hovel later," Will mumbled as he made his way to Matt's wool shop.  He found Matt talking with Carl outside of the wool shop. Carl and Matticus were hands down the best fighters in Rift, possibly best in the whole region. "Hey Matt,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>

Carl headed off to the armory to sharpen some blades for the civil defense system. "What's up, Will?" Matt asked. "I've been finding... some things in the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>

I'm convinced there's at least thirty people out there." "Will," Matticus started as he took Will by the shoulder and walked the walkways of midlevel Rift. "The world is young. New<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>

Cressmopolis is no longer a tradepost, but a full fledged city." "I know, but-" "We can't jump to conclusions. All I can say is to keep an eye out on the jungle." Matticus saw Bio and left Will to<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"The city is built into a ravine. There's two entrances from the surface, probably more underground. Josh can tell you more," DC started. It<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 34</a><div class="page-content">was a chilly night, and the dampness of the jungle wasn't helping anyone's attitude. "Josh, you actually been in dis' ere place? What's it like?" Scope asked, huddled around the pitiful fire. Josh stood up. "A hole in the ground. A hole filled with food,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"That's what she said," someone blurted. The group gave out a chuckle as someone retorted, "only your mother, Carter!" and the group laughed even</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 34</a><div class="page-content">more.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The group became silent.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The smiles faded. "B-boss, we was just-" Josh started. "Just what? Laughing that the Ancaps have<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

The group looked around, silent.  "We're riding out. Dead of night. Take the first floor, they'll have nowhere to run." The smiles returned.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 34</a><div class="page-content">It was that dream again. The sun setting on the city of towers, gold, obsidian, diamonds everywhere, and crops he didn't even recognize growing in massive gardens. The city went on beyond the horizon. It was beautiful yet<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 34</a><div class="page-content">terrifying.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Will awoke in a sweat, with a massive headache. He sat up in bed and fought to withold the liquor trying to escape his stomach. In the midst of it all he thought he heard a noise coming from outside his door, in the city. A scream maybe? But<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 34</a><div class="page-content">the punding within his own head proved to be stronger as Will stumbled into his washroom. As he splashed his face with water, his door bursted open with a crash.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Ttk almighty, who the hell is there?" Will questioned. There was a silence, and then<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I said who the hell is there-" as he turned the corner to look, a man in full armor was upon him. The stranger swung his sword which Will ducked under and pushed himself into his attacker's legs, both of them tumbling onto the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

Will heard the armored foe's sword land behind him as they fell so he struck his enemy in the head, helmet and all. As the stranger was dazed, Will turned to grab the sword and swing it into his foe's head just as he lifted his<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">head forward. And with that it was over. The armored stranger didn't move anymore as a puddle of blood formed underneath his neck. Will grabbed the sword and his boots and headed for his door. The first thing he felt was the heat.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Somewhere something<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

Everywhere on his floor people were fighting. More armored strangers chased around Will's fellow citizens of the Rift. And he watched them die.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Lookout!" Someone yelled to him. Will<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Will! Are you alright?" Matticus asked him as he approached him. In tail with Matticus was Carl and Grezz, each firing arrows across the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

But Will already knew. "We're under attack, Will." Matticus started. "The upper level has already fallen."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was then Will looked up and saw where the intense heat was coming from. Above them</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 34</a><div class="page-content">all, the top level of the Rift was ablaze. Pieces of flaming wood and cloth rained around them, as the top level was reduced to nothing but an inferno.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"There's no way out," Carl said.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"We're gathering who we can and heading to the bottom levels."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Tux and I excorted the first few to the bottom level. I came back up to fight, he stayed down to help evacuate," Carl informed Will.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Just then, four of the raiders grappled down right on top of the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

Will stood, not able to move himself to abandon his friend.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Will! Over here!" It was Liam. Will ran to Liam who was at the top of the stairs leading to the level<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content">beneath them. Will made it to Liam and looked back, Matticus and Grezz fought on, as Carl was knocked over the balcony and tumbled all the way down the four stories of inner Rift.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Will, come on!" And so they went down the stairs. Around them, Rift was<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"At the bottom still I assume. We got seperated on the above levels where the fighting was thickest."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"How did this happen?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
