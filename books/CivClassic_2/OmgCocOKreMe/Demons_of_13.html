Leviathan must be caged due to some violent urges against Succubus that he can't seem to control.

Succubus is the magma cube that can be seen</div></div>

Succubus once had two brothers, one of equal size that was called Incubus, and one that was barley large enough to be considered an inconvenience, called Gello. One day Incubus</div></div>

Gello made a deal with the devil to become as large as his brothers, but at the cost of his residency in the Hell. He can be found in a small enclosure right outside the Lazuli Tower to this day.

Which finally brings us to the stoners of the Hell, the striders. These peaceful</div></div>

Mammon and Nephilim can be seen to your left, while Tartaruchi is usually found in a lava pool on the far side of the Hell. These are the only demons</div></div>
