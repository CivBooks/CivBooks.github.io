There is a breakroom of sorts located in the centre of the build. This breakroom is in a hole in the ground. The ground is around 5-7 metres below the height of the buildings</div></div>

Workers may have to jump down to the ground and risk injuring themselves. There are three staircases constructed between the ground and the floor. These staircases are made out of rigid</div></div>

In order to go up these stairs, workers need to physically jump up each step due to the height between each step. The breakroom itself is quite small.
