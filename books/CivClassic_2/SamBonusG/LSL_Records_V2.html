Subject 046 has died. The handler approacheds the habitat right as it was happening, and so was able to see the cause of death. It seems the subject died in a similar way to subject</div></div>

Subject #051

Subject 051 safely inserted into habitat. Spawn egg curiously produced two</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">subjects, which seem to have a parent-offspring relationship. A smaller subject sits atop the head of a larger one. The subjects immediatley showed signs of being cold despite the high temperature of the habitat, and immediatley went to bathe in the lava.</div></div>

All subjects successfully insertedd into habitat. All found immeddiate comfort in the pool of lava. However, subject 051 remains the only strider spawn with a child.

Subject #057</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject inserted into habitat successfully. Subject is small, at least in comparison to the original sizes of Incubus and Succubus from the hell floor of Lazuli Tower. Subject stared at handler for a moment before giving chase.

Subject 058 even smaller than subject 057, not even tall enough to reach the handler's waist. This did not hinder the subject's determination to attack the handler however, as its behavior was similar to subject 057 in that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">it began to pursue the handler. Once again, handler was able to outrun the subject with ease.

The child of subject 051 has already grown to full size in a manner of minutes. However, the child continues to stay atop the parent, making for an adorable strider</div></div>

Subject #059

Subject 059 inserted into habitat through hole in the glass wall. This did not prevent the handler from damage however, as the subject began to immediatley spit fireballs through the hole in the wall as the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">handler tried to name it. The handler was burned, but not killed, and the subject was successfully named.
Subject began to levitate to the roof of the habitat before lowering itself into the lava pool where it remained.

Remaining subjects cannot be inserted</div></div>

With seven striders, two magma cubes, and one blaze, this proves that each chunk can only hold a total of ten spawned mobs before peaking out. The nametags for subjects 060-064 will be reserved for the next installment.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject 060 is now to be spawned from a hoglin egg in habitat 1A. This caused concern for the handlers due to the rage that subject 022 showed after being hit during the last interaction. However, upon entering the habitat the subjects did not attack the handler, so</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">it seems subject 022 has gotten over its rage from the previous encounter. It is believed that the hoglins will not show hostility towards the piglins, but may towards the handler.

<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the first hoglin attack.

Subject #060

Subject 060 inserted into habitat from within the enclosure. Subject immediately began to attack the handler upon being spawned. After handler had safely escaped the habitat, subject 060 began to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">attack subject 024. Subject 060 could not fight well, and subject 024 did not even notice the attacks. Subject 060 began trembling for about thirty seconds before zombifying. After zombification, subject showed massive stregnth and attacked subject 024 a second time. Upon damage</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">dealt to subject 024, all subjects in the habitat began to swarm subject 060. Subject 060 was killed in a matter of seconds. Thus drawing us the conclusion that piglins and hoglins cannot be spawned in the same place.

Tenth installment:
Subjects 061-063 are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">now to be inserted into habitat 2A. Subjects are to be spawned from polar bear eggs. Handler will be spawning all three subjects from within the cage, as it is known that these creatures are completely harmless as long as they are not provoked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subjects #061-#062

Both subjects successfully inserted into habitat with no issue. Subjects seem entirely uninterested in the handler.

Subject #063

Subject 063 inserted into the habitat in the form of a cub. In an</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">unexpected turn of events, subject 062 seems to have developed a maternal instinct towards subject 063, and slaughtered the handler as it thought the handler may be endangering the cub. The cub could not be named, as the nametag that was with the slaughtered handler</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">is by the door inside the habitat, and subject 062 is waiting  by the door to attack another. There is worry that if the cub is not named, it will despawn from existence. Only time can tell unfortunately.

The cub has survived and grown into an adult.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Eleventh installment:
Subjects 064-066 to be inserted into habitat 3D. Subjects are to be spawned from guardian eggs. Guardian are known to attack anything within sight, so precaution will be handled while inserting them into the habitat. Habitat has been filled with water and prismarine</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">structures to imitate the natural environment of the guardians.

Subject #064:

Subject 064 successfully inserted into habitat. Subject immediatley tried to attack the handler with some kind of laser beam, but the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">beam did not seem to
have any affect on the handler.

Subject #065:

Handler entered habitat to insert subject 065. Upon entry, subject 064 once again shot a laser at the handler. The handler sustained</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">damage this time, but not nearly enough to cause an evacuation before subject 065 was inserted and named.

Subject #066

Subject 066 successfully inserted into habitat. Minimal damage to the handler caused by lasers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">from subjects 064 and 065, but ultimately a successful installment.


All subjects in habitat 1A have mysteriously disappeared. They are to be replaced by subjects 067-069 which are to be spawned from hoglin eggs. The mysterious</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">disappearance of the piglins suggests that they do not fare well in captivity.

Subject #067

Subject 067 inserted into habitat 1A by handler. Subject immediately showed high levels of aggression and slaughtered its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">handler. Subject proceeded to tremor for approximatley thirty seconds before zombifying, as hoglins tend to do when outside of their natural nether biome.

Subject #068

Subject 068 inserted into habitat 1A through a hole in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">glass wall as to prevent another handler from getting slaughtered. Subject managed to slaughter the handler anyway through the glass wall, showing incredible strength. Similar to the previous subject's behavior, the hoglin trembled for about thrity seconds before</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">zombifying. Initial concerns that the two zombified hoglins may show aggression towards one another was soon put to rest, as both subject's seem entirely tolerable of each other despite their extremely aggressive behavior towards handlers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #069

Subject 069 successfully inserted into habitat. Subject predictably attacked the handler through the glass wall that it was inserted through, but nobody was killed this time. Subject began to tremble before zombifying, just like the previous</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 50</a><div class="page-content">subjects. Subjects 067 and 068 have congregated by the door to the habitat. This has lead the researchers to conclude that hoglins like to get to the lowest ground possible.</div></div>
