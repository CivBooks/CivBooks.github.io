<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This is the question. If you want an answer to the question, you need only keep reading! If you are against racism, keep reading! If you are for always having enough for everyone, keep reading!</div></div>

We are just as human as everyone else, no more, no less. Capitalists often promise "Liberty" or "Freedom" as part of their systems. But what does this concept of "Freedom" really mean?</div></div>

It's not fair at all. Do you feel very "free" while carrying that weight along with you, watching some people sail on past you? Probably not. But such is capitalist "freedom!"</div></div>
