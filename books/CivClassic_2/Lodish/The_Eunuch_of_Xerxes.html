originally from
Pedasus, and we know
of no case where a
man has taken a more
fearful revenge for
an injury than he did.
He was put up for
sale as a prisoner of
war and brought by a
Chian called Panionius,
a man who made his
living by the</div></div>

castrating any
good-looking boys he
could get hold of, and
taking them to Sardis
or Ephesus, where he
sold them at a high
price - for it is a fact
that among the
barbarians eunuchs
are valued as being
specially trustworthy
in every way.</div></div>

boys whom Panionius,
in the course of his
trade, had treated in
this way, was Hermotimus.
Nevertheless, he was
not without his share
of luck; for he was
taken from Sardis and
sent with a number of
other things as a
present to the king,</div></div>

to be valued by
Xerxes more highly
than any other of his
eunuchs. At the time
when Xerxes was at
Sardis at the start of
his march to Athens,
Hermotimus had gone
on business to

Mysia which belongs to</div></div>

much for him in
return, if only he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">would bring his family
to Sardis and settle
there. Panionius was
delighted, and brought
his wife and children
accordingly. Then,
having got him and his
whole household into
his power, Hermotimus
said: 'No man ever
