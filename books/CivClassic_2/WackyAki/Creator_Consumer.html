<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 13</a><div class="page-content">If we were to go back in time a few hundred years, the world would, obviously, look a lot different. Aside from technological and intellectual differences, one of the core elements that past human society posessed that has been lost is the relationship between one and ones work.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Take, for example, a tomato. Today, we drive to the grocery store, buy a tomato, go through a self checkout and then take it home to eat and use. A few hundred years ago, should you be lucky enough to have tomato's to eat, you would only be able to buy it from a farmer</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">who you would have known your whole life, and you would have eaten the tomato at home knowing that he or she fed you and you paid them for the food, providing their income. The major difference here is that our modern day society doesn't have that degree of relationship. Today,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">we are completely and utterly divorced from the producer and consumer. When you work to create, you have no idea who is consuming, and vice versa, creating an inevidable divide between these two groups. The divide is, ultimately, going to tear apart the western world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">How much can you possibly care for people's struggles if you don't interact with them? How can you know a poor fast food worker's problems if the extent of your interaction with them is through the drive-thru window? While it starts on issues like Healthcare, it will quickly expand</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">to impact every single issue that modern society faces. All because we don't have a platform and way to have a constructive dialogue with those who's material conditions are different from our own. Access to education, for example, is greatly reduced for the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">poor compared to the rich and middle class, and while a few hundred years ago the daily interactions we had would have revealed this disparagement, nowadays the divide brances this issue. 

This is a simple byproduct of several conscious choices.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">First, corportations that employ tens of millions nationwide have little to no care for the health and relationship the communities they inhabit have. These major corporations only care for profits, leading to workers working longer hours in worse living conditions. Second,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">we generated artifical neighborhoods in the middle of nowhere, completely divorced from organic community development and locations of social interaction. Big yards, hour long commutes anywhere, and the constant push to stay inside prevents any form of community from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">suburbs. Finally, we have a lens issue. American and western society has completely allowed the media to have complete control over their perceptions of the poor and those fighting for their causes. The news regularly calls those asking for higher wages "selfish" and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">laments those who demand healthcare as "entitled." Because the worker and the product that they made and who consumes it is completely divorced, the news can get away with this incessant narrative and allow for the working class and the consumers to be divided.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">There is no easy way to fix this. Unfortunately, people use social media to interact with those in their own class, and people buy 30 yr loans to afford their houses. The way out will be tumulous, and will involve a great breakthrough in class cosciousness and an awareness of how</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 13</a><div class="page-content">we are more similar than apart. Finally, the reebirth of the relationship between the developer and the consumer is essential.</div></div>
