~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The HCF war has left the server in ruins. IN those ruins, however, players have grown stronger. We are now seeing the rise of new cities, new forms of organization, and new styles of play that are stronger</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 46</a><div class="page-content">and more well-thought-out than previously imagined. Players have survived the violence and thrived, and the experiment continues.

Despite these triumphs and the new renaissance triggered by the (virtually) full release of the world-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 46</a><div class="page-content">edge vault, many victims (and the friends of victims) are wondering why this has all happened.

Clearly a large part of the blame and causal efficacy lies at the feet of the HCF members who perpetrated violence upon Civcraft.  There</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 46</a><div class="page-content">is no doubt about this, and this is not meant to be a work of apology for that.  The violence, theft, and damage that has been done to the server has been on many scales.  This work is meant to address a single scale: the indefinite nature of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 46</a><div class="page-content">inprisonments perpetrated by the HCF.  In a GITMO-fashioned facility, they held combatant, political dissident, and resistance fighter alike with tight paranoia--letting any of them go might lead to them being permanently pearled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 46</a><div class="page-content">in the end.  Given that they wanted to stay on the server, they felt they couldn't risk setting free their eventual captors. 

This leads us to a natural question, which this book is meant to address: "Why did the HCF garner such paranoia? Why did it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 46</a><div class="page-content">feel it necessary to permanently pearl Civcraftians, innocent or combatant.  Why would they want to remove others from play, thus halting the experiment?"

Clearly there are simple explanations here, such as "they were in it for the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 46</a><div class="page-content">lulz" or "they are psychopaths" or "they simply love ruining peoples' time".  All of these things may be true, but there is another partial cause that this book is meant to directly address:

Norms of Violence and Imprisonment established by AnCap</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 46</a><div class="page-content">WorldPolice Members are partially responsible for HCF's harsh imprisonment policies.

This is written in the hope that we learn as a community, and that those in the future fail to repeat the mistakes of our generation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~By "WorldPolice" or "AnCaps" I simply mean a particular group of players that typically hangs out in the Mumble channel "Cool Kids Club" or "Bat Cave".  This includes Matticus_Rex, Foofed, ServerError,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Exultant, and others.  They are bound by a loose tie to "anarcho-capitalist" political ideology (thus the term "the AnCaps") but as NateMagic said it best, they are a group of "loud mouthed bounty hunters".  Thus, I will refer to them as the "World</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Police".  They mainly earned this term historically by intervening in sovereign countries, often flouting local laws and conventions.

By "HCF" I mean to include HCF and all splinter-factions thereof.  Clearly there are many political</div></div>

------
The WorldPolice sanctioned various players in its history with permanent (or indefinite) imprisonment.  These players fall into a few broad categories:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 46</a><div class="page-content">(1) Players committing offenses so serious they "warranted permanent imprisonment".  For instance, Josh, for his repeated and thorough destruction of cities, was pearled indefinitely.  Other extreme griefers were treated in similar fashion, along with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 46</a><div class="page-content">large-scale thiefs. For examples, search the reddit for "pearling" threads. Examples abound.

(2) Prisoners who owed a "doable" amount of damages, but who had no reasonable way to produce payment.  Players in this class simply owed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 46</a><div class="page-content">too much; they couldn't feasible play Minecraft for dozens of hours a week just to release themselves from imaginary prison, and so they were effectively permanently imprisoned.

(3) Presumed recidivists.  Many</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 46</a><div class="page-content">cases, the adjudicators simply judged that the criminal could not and would not reform.  This subjective judgment was used as excuse to keep the person imprisoned, regardless of the nature or severity of the offense.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 46</a><div class="page-content">(4) Players who were totally unknown.  Many players kept by the WorldPolice were kept without reason, as nobody holding the pearls could remember why they were held. Thus, they were held because "it would be too risky to release them".  This GITMO-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 46</a><div class="page-content">style logic (keep them
in case they retaliate
or are somehow, perhaps, enemies), of course, is more likely than anything to produce enemies. Besides, it attempts to rights ones previous mistakes by sweeping the "problem" (people) under the rug.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Needless to say, permanent imprisonment became a norm on the server (except for the leftist sections of the server, who have never until recently even held a prison pearl).  With the exception of organizations such as the Pumpkin Jacks, who allowed for</div></div>

This established a norm; getting pearled became tantamount to dying, especially when sanctioned by the WorldPolice.  No normal player or group at the time had the military resources</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 46</a><div class="page-content">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Rational Response to WorldPopo Violence Norms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~When considering how to approach an enemy, one should consider how that enemy might react.  Often, examining rational response is a good first approximation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 46</a><div class="page-content">While people fall far short of rationality, people who are capable of even a *modicum* of analysis and careful thought will settle on, more or less, rational solutions.  Regardless, it's important to investigate the rational response to the threats of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 46</a><div class="page-content">violence that was presented by the WorldPolice during the HCF invasion.  Despite the clear irrationality of certain members of the HCF, it seems clear that the group as a whole would be more likely to stumble upon a clear-headed and rational response.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Let me preface this analysis with a bit of history.  As evidenced in the early youtube video by ApacheBlitz ("Slaying AnCaps"), HCF members were *discarding prison pearls*.  Rather than keeping WorldPopo members for imprisonment, they were simply</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 46</a><div class="page-content">interested in besting them in combat.

Even when HCF members began to imprison players, they were released within a day or two.  I can attest to this myself; I was released along with many other prisoners a day or two after the initial</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 46</a><div class="page-content">invasion.  I fell in battle during the initial battle of Augusta, but was subsequently released when the battle was over.

Why were we released?

The explanation given at the time, and the one that seems most reasonable, is that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 46</a><div class="page-content">death-ban norms on HCF are much different than the norm of violence and imprisonment crafted by the WorldPopo on Civcraft.  Given that HCF death-bans are temporary, it made sense that HCF members would release their prisoners gradually.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 46</a><div class="page-content">What changed?

HCF members were wise to the reddit. They saw that WorldPopo memembers habitually imprisoned people indefinitely.  They saw that they were under threat of being imprisoned indefinitely. Given that this was a possibility (rather</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 46</a><div class="page-content">than the norms they were used to on HCF), the game changed immediately.

Now there was a non-zero probability that their players would be *taken out of the occassion*.  Thus, if they continued to release their enemies (or potential enemies)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 46</a><div class="page-content">they simply created a possibility of being beaten forever.

This explains the indefinite imprisonment and the growing paranoia that even the innocent members they held would become violent.  Knowing that they had made mistakes, they began</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 46</a><div class="page-content">to feel exposed by the possibities they knew were lurking in the shadows.  They could release the WorldPopo or others, of course, but they *knew* they would be risking permanent imprisonment.  And sure enough, since then, they have been hunted down for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 46</a><div class="page-content">precisely this purpose.

Given repeated play and enough repetitions, dynamic systems end up in "absorbing states" or states where things cease to change.  The HCF knew that continually freeing their competition meant risking getting</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 46</a><div class="page-content">themselves permanently pearled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 46</a><div class="page-content">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~6. Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The conclusion I believe we can draw from this is that extreme threats serve no-one.  Everyone has the time and inclination to play this game. People orchestrate and pull off operations from the End.  They</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 46</a><div class="page-content">stay active on the Mumble and on the Reddit.  They find ways of playing on alts or VPNs.  Regardless of whether these methods are right or legal (from the server's perspective) is not the point; the behavior exists.

Given this, we should</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 46</a><div class="page-content">all learn to live with each other.  If permanent imprisonment were *never* on the table to begin with, we would not have seen this server's longest dark ages, where dozens of the most productive and bright citizens (not to mention the numberless droves of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 46</a><div class="page-content">the nameless, who clearly matter as well) were imprisoned for no reason at all.  

Rather than flinging blame around at each other, we have to learn to live in this post-war world together.  Understanding the causes for various</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 46</a><div class="page-content">behaviors is important, and I hope by doing so, we learn to avoid these unfortunate mistakes in the future.
