"That's some autism right there" - Senator Gezoerksel.


As many of you are</div></div>

While building the park I noticed a high and unusual amount of</div></div>

It would be only  a month later that I would decipher the runes on the side of the bridge which meant "Lake of Butthurt Tears".

The most fascinating find was what appeared to be ruins of a bathhouse, however the only entrance I could find was partially collapsed and I could not enter.

It also served a second purpose as a heat source so deep in the cold earth. Indeed, they exploited lava on a grand scale. It was trapped in ceilings and walls all across the district. The district was well preserved for the</div></div>

I feel like I've only scratched a small portion of a much larger city that streches all underneath Danzig.

I recorded dozens of small, simple houses of the same design.</div></div>

Or perhaps that district was populated by a low caste with heavy restrictions to limit their freedom and aspirations. Between the 'streets' of houses ran a stream of water.
