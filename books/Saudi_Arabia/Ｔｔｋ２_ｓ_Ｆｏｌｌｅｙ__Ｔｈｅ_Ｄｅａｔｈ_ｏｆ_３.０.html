<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Many answers have, of course, been proposed: theories have sprung up abundantly placing the blame at the feet of the playerbase, of unnamed third-party actors, and of the</div></div>

However, to truly define the issue that led to the collapse of an enduring and popular server, we must first go back in time, back to the earliest known period of Civcraft, the pre-HCF period.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The pre-HCF period</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 48</a><div class="page-content">of Civcraft (sometimes referred to as Old Civraft) began immediately after the beginning of 1.0 in early 2012 and lasted until the first HCF invasion in December of the same year. The pre-HCF era was marked by the spread of the first and earliest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 48</a><div class="page-content">cultures. During the course of 2012, three main cultural groups were formed and spread out over the map: the Civvie cultural group (Civvies), the Roman cultural group (Romans), and the Spanish cultural group (Spainiards). Of these three groups, the most</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 48</a><div class="page-content">dominant was, by far, the Civvie group that came to populate the entire map.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">More specifically, the Civvie culture that existed in the pre-HCF era is today considered one of the many culture that are branches of the Civvie "mothergroup", the all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 48</a><div class="page-content">encompassing denomination that includes all Civcraftian cultures. Although today we know of dozens of such different Civvie  subcultures, there was only one such culture that existed in pre-HCF Civcraft. Today, it is know as <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">Old Civvie.<span class="fmt0"></span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 48</a><div class="page-content">It was during this brief period of cultural homogenity that the Civcraft admin team was convened and cemented together.

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">However, with the first HCF invasion and the beginning of the HCF war, the pre-HCF period of Civcraft came to an end, and the cultural dominance of Old Civvies was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 48</a><div class="page-content">shattered as a new cultural group was brought in by the HCF invaders, who began to settle in the server. The first new culture to arrive upon the server was <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">voucherism<span class="fmt0"> (derived from the proto-factions term "to vouch [for]"). These vouchers, former</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 48</a><div class="page-content">raiders and members of the hundred-strong HCF invader groups, slowly settled into Civcraft and began to adapt and assimilate into the server. However, the rapid and violent contact between the Old Civvies and the Vouchers resulted in many massacres,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 48</a><div class="page-content">often committed by the militarily-superior vouchers. Over the course of the year, the unrelenting voucher influence created a new branch of Civvie culture termed <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">New Civvie<span class="fmt0"> (or Neo-Civvie), one that would come to almost completely replace the Old</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Civvie branch after a couple of years. Furhermore, the cultural diversification of the server would not stop there: the second great migration of a new culture, the <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">Channers<span class="fmt0">, would occur in late 2014 and early 2015. However, all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 48</a><div class="page-content">throughout these extreme cultural shifts to the server, the admin team remained the same- a small, contained bubble of Old Civvie culture, cut off from their cultural kin, once the inhabitants of this vast server but reduced to small pockets in</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The reason it is important to talk about culture in this case is because the cultural makeup of the server was more than an inconsequential byproduct of roll-play, much like</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 48</a><div class="page-content">are widly different between themselves. This is why the fact that Civcraft's Ttk2ist administration team, a pocket of archaic Old Civviism, created the admin-player divide that eventually tore the entire server apart.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">One of the most prominent and destructive side effects of the Old Civvie administration group running a server where their mentality died out years ago is one that is well-documented and pervasive among Old</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The reasons for this particular fear being rampant within the Old Civvie community are obvious, as the Old Civvies were the first to come in contact with the wildly different Vouchers and</div></div>

Indeed, early Civcraft suffered a series of HCF invasions; however there was a direct correlation between the diminishing population of the Old Civvies and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 48</a><div class="page-content">potency and destructiveness of the ensuing HCF invasions in the first part of the second map. This can be explained mostly by the heightened ability of New Civvies to fight vouchers on a military level, and the closer cultural link between the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 48</a><div class="page-content">voucher-influenced New Civvies and the vouchers themselves.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">As the fear of repeating HCF invasions slowly disappeared in the general population of Civcraft, it persisted in the administration team and led to a series of unpopular decisions</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 48</a><div class="page-content">that only furthered the divide between admins and players. These seemingly misplaced decisions, such as the famous banning of Phac3d or the "e-rape" bans can be understood when they are analyzed through the cultural angle. It then becomes apparent that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 48</a><div class="page-content">the admin team took such anti-HCF actions due to the pervasive fear, impregnated into the Old Civvie mind, that the Voucher would be directly responsible for the death of Civcraft and thus needed to be stopped.<span class="fmt0"></span>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Unfortunately, the ultimate reason for the death of Civcraft was the cultural distance that the admin team took with regards to their playerbase. This cultural difference affected their mindset, and caused them to take highly</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 48</a><div class="page-content">unpopular decisions with regards to the direction of the server.

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Currently, Civcraft seems to be in its death throes. The slow exodus of all but the most grind-minded players continues, and the daily activity has flatlined at 0 active players. Rather than reversing their decisions and</div></div>
